non-performance of it constitutes internationally wrongful conduct. any aspects of domestic law hindering compliance were no excuse, the icj emphasized. on 14 june 2011, senator patrick leahy introduced a bill in us congress aimed at implementing the icj judgment, as well as facilitating compliance with article 36 of the vccr. lawyers for humberto leal sought a stay of execution long enough to allow to congress to act on the legislation. the courts refused to grant a stay. the texas board of pardons and paroles voted against a reprieve to allow time for congress to act, despite three judges on the texas court of criminal appeals urging an executive reprieve. the three judges noted that it is precisely when the judicial department proves institutionally unequal to the task that the exercise of executive clemency is most appropriate. the us supreme court refused to grant a stay on 7 july, over the dissent of four of the nine justices. both the us and mexican government had filed legal briefs in the supreme court supporting the request for a stay of execution (see overleaf). the courts majority noted that the us administration and the dissenting justices complain of the grave international consequences that will follow from leals execution, but added that congress evidently did not find these consequences sufficiently grave to prompt its enactment of implementing legislation, and we will follow the law as written by congress. we have no authority to stay an execution in light of an appeal of the president, presenting free-ranging assertions of foreign policy consequences, when those assertions come unaccompanied by a persuasive legal claim. among those appealing for the execution not to go ahead was the un high commissioner for human rights, who wrote directly to governor rick perry calling for his intervention. the un special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and the un special rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment also called on the authorities to stop the execution. governor perry refused to grant a reprieve. in his final statement before being killed by lethal injection, humberto leal expressed his remorse: i have hurt a lot of people. let this be final and be done. i take the full blame for this. i am sorry and forgive me, i am truly sorry. he was pronounced dead at 6.21pm local time. humberto leal was the 26th person to be executed in the usa this year, and the 1,260nd since judicial killing resumed in 1977. texas accounts for 471 of these executions, seven of which have been carried out this year. no further action is requested. many thanks to all who sent appeals. additional information mexico brought its vccr case against the usa in 2003, resulting in the icjs judgment in avena and other mexican nationals handed down on 31 march 2004. the usa has yet to comply with the avena judgment. on 28 february 2005, then-president george w. bush responded to the icj decision by seeking to have the state courts provide the necessary review and reconsideration in all of the affected cases. the texas court of criminal appeals later ruled that the president lacked the constitutional authority to order state court compliance and that the avena decision was not enforceable in the domestic courts. the case went to the us supreme court. on 25 march 2008, in medelln v. texas, the supreme court unanimously found that the avena decision constitutes an international law obligation on the part of the united states. the court also unanimously agreed that the reasons for complying with the icj judgment were plainly compelling, since its domestic enforcement would uphold united states interests in ensuring the reciprocal observance of the vienna convention, protecting relations with foreign governments, and demonstrating commitment to the role of international law. however, a 6-3 majority ruled that the icjs decision is not automatically binding domestic law and that the authority for implementing it rested not with the president but with congress (see",0,"humberto leal"

sentenced to death in 2002 for the murder of an indian immigrant following the 9/11 attacks in the usa. a bangladeshi man he also shot during a series of post-9/11 crimes is calling for clemency. on 4 october 2001, vasudev patel, a native of india who had lived near dallas, texas, for 10 years, was shot and killed in the petrol station he and his wife operated there. the shooting was captured on surveillance camera, and the following day mark anthony stroman was arrested at his home. the murder was part of a series of violent crimes in the area following 11 september 2001 for which mark stroman claimed responsibility. he said he committed them in retaliation for the 9/11 attacks, against people he considered of middle eastern descent. at his trial for the murder of vasudev patel, the state also introduced evidence that on 15 september 2001 mark stroman had shot and killed a pakistani immigrant, waqar hasan, at his grocery shop, and on 21 september 2001 had shot rais bhuiyan, an immigrant from bangladesh in the service station where he was working. rais bhuiyan survived, despite being shot in the face with a shotgun at close range. in april 2002, a jury convicted mark stroman of capital murder, namely murdering vasudev patel in the course of an actual or attempted robbery. on appeal in federal court, mark stromans lawyer argued that due to mental impairment he did not have the necessary criminal intent to commit capital murder. instead, she has argued that, in a paranoid, delusional state, mark stroman shot these individuals believing they were arab, enemies-of-the-united states. she has presented expert mental health evidence in support of this claim. rais bhuiyan has recounted how, when mark stroman walked into his store, he offered the gunman cash and pleaded not to be shot. in reply [stroman] asked me, where are you from?. when rais bhuiyan said excuse me?, he was shot in the face. he survived, underwent multiple surgeries, and has lost sight in his right eye. today he is appealing for mark stroman not to be executed and for his death sentence to be commuted. he says hate doesnt bring a peaceful solution to any situation, which i realized after i became a victim of a hate crime because of the september 11, 2001 world trade center tragedy. this single incident changed my entire life and helped me to realize that hate only brings fear, misery, resentment and disaster into human lives. it creates obstacles to healthy human growth, which, in turn, diminishes society as a wholei forgave mark stroman many years ago. i believe he was ignorant, and not capable of distinguishing between right and wrong, otherwise he wouldnt have done what he did. background information according to the states evidence, in pre-trial custody after killing vasudev patel, mark stroman had told another inmate that the shooting had been his patriotic duty and this country hadnt done their job so he was going to do it for them. the texas authorities have asserted that it is evident from the trial testimony that stroman decided to express his anger for the september 11, 2001, terrorist attacks by killing people he believed were native to the middle and far east, and that this was his apparent motive for killing patel. it said robbery was not a motive in the murder of waqar hasan and that neither had mark stroman taken any money during the attempted murder of rais bhuiyan. in the case of vasudev patel, mark stroman had demanded money but shot him. he then demanded that the victim, who was lying fatally wounded on the floor, open the cash register. at mark stromans trial, his lawyer obtained expert mental health evidence, but not in time for the guilt phase of the trial. at the sentencing phase, the lawyer presented expert evidence of the defendants childhood abuse and mental impairments. one expert testified that without the combination of abuse and neglect, rejection, untreated behavioural disorder, and the affects of drug addiction, it is unlikely that [stroman] would have become a violent person who would engage in such acts. the other expert testified that, in her opinion, mark stroman had a significant history of posttraumatic stress disorder (ptsd) and that brain scan results indicated that he had brain damage. the jury nevertheless passed a death sentence. mark stromans appeal lawyer has argued that stroman did not have the necessary state of mind to commit capital murder, and that the trial lawyer should have presented expert evidence to this effect. she has presented conclusions of an expert in child and drug abuse whose opinion is that mark stroman did not have the necessary mental state for him to be guilty of capital murder under texas law, due to mental impairments resulting from childhood neglect, abuse, ptsd, possible bipolar disorder, organic brain damage, and a 17 year addiction to methamphetamine. she said that this, coupled with a 12-13 day sleepless binge on methamphetamine, resulted in paranoid and delusional behaviour and aggression during which mr stroman actually believed that he was acting on behalf of the american people to avenge the events of september 11, 2001. the appeal lawyer has pointed to a 2008 ruling of the texas court of criminal appeals which states that: mental diseases or defects may affect a persons perception of the world just as much as they may affect his rational understanding of his conduct or his capacity to make moral judgments. if the defendant suffers from mental delusions such that he sees a trespasser or a muslim when everyone else around him sees a police officer, he cannot be convicted of intentionally shooting at a police officer, although he may be convicted of intentionally shooting at a trespasser or muslim. guilt of the specific offence of shooting a police officer requires that the state prove, beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant intended to shoot a police officer, not a trespasser or muslim. nevertheless, in 2009, the us district court upheld mark stromans conviction for capital murder, concluding that the evidence of his mental impairment was insufficient under us law to warrant relief. although the state has argued that mark stroman has shown no remorse for his crimes, he has written: i cannot tell you that i am an innocent man. i am not asking you to feel sorry for me and i wont hide the truth. i am a human being and made a terrible mistake out of love, grief and anger, and believe me i am paying for it every single minute of the day and it haunts me in my sleep as well lets just say that [after 9/11] i could not think clearly anymore and i am sorry to say i made innocent people pay for my rage, anger, grief and loss. i have destroyed my victims families as well as my own. amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases, regardless of the crime, the offender, or the method of execution. there have been 1,258 executions in the usa since

to be executed in the us state of alabama on 16 june. he was sentenced to death in 1998 for a murder in 1995. his lawyers claim that he has a mental disability that would render his execution unconstitutional. mattie wesson, a 70-year-old white woman, was raped and shot dead in her home near tuscaloosa, alabama, in the early hours of 25 march 1995. eddie powell, who lived across the street from the victim, was brought to trial in 1997. after the jury was unable to decide on whether to recommend life imprisonment or death, and after the judge agreed that there had been prosecutorial misconduct at the guilt phase, a full new trial was held in june 1998. eddie powell was again convicted, and this time the jury of 11 whites and one african american voted by 11 to one to recommend the death penalty. the jury heard some mitigating evidence at the trial, including that eddie powell had been assessed as mildly retarded at around the age of 10 and placed in special education classes. four years after the trial, the us supreme court ruled, in atkins v. virginia, that the execution of people who had mental retardation violated the us constitution. the court did not define mental retardation, but pointed to definitions used by professional bodies. under such definitions, it is a disability, manifested before the age of 18, characterized by significantly sub-average intellectual functioning (generally indicated by an iq of less than 70) accompanied by limitations in two or more adaptive skill areas such as communication, self-care, work, and functioning in the community. the court left it to individual states to develop appropriate ways to comply with the ruling. after the supreme courts ruling, eddie powells appeal lawyers raised an atkins claim, but were unsuccessful. none of the state or federal court held an evidentiary hearing on the issue before ruling against powell. eddie powell has recently been assessed by a clinical psychologist. dr harvey switzky, who has concluded that when one puts all the evidence together, eddie presents as a person with significantly sub-average general intellectual functioning in the mild range of mental retardation. eddie was considered as functioning in the mentally retarded range by his family and the educational system during the developmental period. he has also pointed to considerable evidence that eddies mental retardation was exacerbated by a chaotic, violent, dysfunctional family social environment, brain injury and drug abuse. eddie powells lawyers have appealed to the alabama supreme court to order an evidentiary hearing, and are also seeking executive clemency, including on the grounds that the jury did not hear all available mitigating evidence (see overleaf). background information when the state trial-level court denied eddie powells atkins claim in 2004, the judge found that the claim was refuted by the record and therefore could be dismissed without an evidentiary hearing. among other things, the judge pointed to the trial testimony of dr marianne rosenzweig, a psychologist who had been retained as an expert witness by eddie powells trial lawyers. the reviewing judge noted that at the trial dr rosenzweig said that she had found no evidence to support the mental retardation assessment given to eddie powell at school, and stated that in her opinion he might simply have been suffering depression. in 2007, dr rosenzweig signed a sworn statement in which she stated that she had been retained by the trial lawyers only six weeks before the trial and had considered that this would not be enough time to adequately assist in mr powells defense. in addition, she said that the trial lawyers had never asked her to conduct any psychological testing of the defendant or to confirm mr powells retardation with an iq test or any other testing instrument. as a result, she said, she was unable to diagnose mr powell with mental retardation and instead had attributed his early placement in special education to depression. she said that she had been unaware at that time that eddie powell had spent his entire education career in the lake county, illinois school system in special education classes. if she had known then the information that she had been provided by eddie powells appeal lawyers, i would have insisted that an iq test by performed in mr powells case, and her review of these materials had led her to conclude that during his childhood, mr powell exhibited many characteristics typical of people with mental retardation: including for example, low self-esteem, lack of self-direction, long-term problems with functional academics, feelings of alienation, and problems with concrete thinking. in his recent evaluation of eddie powells intellectual functioning, dr switzky pointed to relevant evidence from the condemned mans birth and childhood. his birth had been a difficult one that had resulted in a lack of oxygen to his brain, and during his pregnancy his mother had abused amphetamine and inhalants such as gasoline and insecticides. eddie powell had been raised in illinois in a high crime neighborhood in dire poverty, and had been emotionally and actually abandoned by his parents which led to eddies frequent depressions, and acts of self-hurt and frequent suicide attempts. in addition, dr switzky continued, eddie suffered multiple head injuries as a child and had been assessed as having sustained damage to the frontal and orbital lobes of his brain. the appeal lawyers have also presented mitigating evidence on appeal that was not presented to the jury, including the young eddie powells witnessing of violence involving his parents, the poverty in which he grew up (including when they lived in subsidized housing in illinois, their apartment was so infested with roaches, rates and bats that the building was eventually condemned), his mothers struggle with mental illness, his fathers alcoholism, and the boys suicide attempts, and his subjection to sexual assaults when held in an adult prison before he was 18. in a ruling by the us district court in 2008 upholding eddie powells death sentence, the federal judge noted that familial violence, severe poverty, alcoholism were not a part of the background evidence presented to the jury, but ruled the outcome of the trial would not have been different even if the jury had heard such evidence. amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases, regardless of the crime, the offender, or the method of execution. there have been 1,254 executions in the usa since judicial killing resumed there in 1977. alabama accounts for 52 of these executions, and has carried out three of the 20 executions in the usa so far this year. faced with a national shortage of sodium thiopental, one of the drugs until now used by most states in their three-drug lethal injection protocols, a number have moved to amend their procedures to allow for an alternative barbiturate as the first of the three drugs, or to one-drug protocols using a barbiturate alone. the substitute to sodium thiopental already selected and used by a number of states already is pentobarbital. in april, alabama announced that it had amended its three-drug protocol to allow for the use of pentobarbital, and the state carried out its first such execution on 19 may. the denmark-based manufacturer of pentobarbital has condemned the use of the drug for executions and has promised that it would continue to urge states in the us to refrain from using pentobarbital for the execution of prisoners as it contradicts everything we stand for as a company. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: - acknowledge the seriousness of the crime of which eddie powell was convicted and explaining that you are not seeking to downplay the seriousness of the crime or the suffering caused; - oppose the execution of eddie powell; - express concern that no court has ever held an evidentiary hearing into the claim that eddie powell has mental retardation, and that the jury did not hear all available mitigating evidence about his background; - note that the power of executive clemency is not constrained in the way courts may be by legal procedures; - call on the governor to grant clemency to eddie powell and to commute his

uan@aiusa.org amnestyusa.org/urgent/ 12 april 2011 ua 110/11   imminent execution usa     troy davis ___________________________________________________________________________ ______________ georgia death row inmate troy davis is facing the possibility of his fourth execution date in four years after the us supreme court dismissed his appeal on 28 march. doubts persist about his guilt in the crime for which he was sentenced to death two decades ago. troy davis was sentenced to death in 1991 for the murder of police officer mark allen macphail in savannah, georgia in 1989. no physical evidence directly links davis to the murder  no murder weapon was ever found. the case against davis primarily rested on witness testimony. since his trial, seven of nine key witnesses have recanted or changed their testimony, some alleging police coercion. in 2009, the us supreme court ordered a federal evidentiary hearing to review troy davis innocence claim. at the hearing in june 2010, us district court judge william moore addressed not whether the state could demonstrate a watertight case against troy davis, but whether davis could show by clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable juror would have convicted him in the light of the new evidence that had emerged since his 1991 murder trial. under this extraordinarily high standard, judge moore wrote, mr davis is not innocent. elsewhere in his ruling, however, he acknowledged that the new evidence presented by troy davis cast some additional, minimal doubt on his conviction, and that the states case was not ironclad. in 1991, the jury had found troy davis guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, judge moore noted, but not to a mathematical certainty. on 28 march, the us supreme court refused to take the davis case, clearing the way for georgia to set an execution date. troy davis was less than 24 hours from execution in 2007 when the georgia board of pardons and paroles issued a stay. the board said in 2007 that it would not allow an execution to go ahead unless and until its members are convinced that there is no doubt as to the guilt of the accused. since then troy davis has faced two more execution dates, both in 2008, which were stayed by the courts. since 2007, three states in the usa have legislated to abolish the death penalty. when signing the abolitionist bills into law the three state governors all pointed to the risk of irrevocable error as a reason to support abolition. since troy davis has been on death row, more than 90 prisoners have been released from death rows around the country on grounds of innocence. in each case, at trial the defendant had been found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. background information in the past four years, three states in the usa  new jersey, new mexico and illinois  have legislated to abolish the death penalty. signing the bills in law, the three governors pointed to the risk of irreversible error in an imperfect system as a reason to support abolition. in 2007, new jersey governor jon corzine said that government cannot provide a foolproof death penalty that precludes the possibility of executing the innocent. in 2009, governor bill richardson of new mexico said that to carry out an irrevocable punishment, we must have ultimate confidence  i would say certitude  that the system is without flaw or prejudice. this, he added, is demonstrably not the case. in march 2011, illinois governor pat quinn said that the capital justice system was inherently flawed, and that it was impossible to devise a system that is consistent, that is free of discrimination on the basis of race, geography or economic circumstance, and that always gets it right. he said that, as a state, we cannot tolerate the executions of innocent people because such actions strike at the very legitimacy of a government. more than 130 people have been released from death rows across the usa since 1976 on the grounds of innocence. among other things the cases reveal the frequent unreliability of witness testimony. the troy davis case is one in which most of the witnesses who testified against the defendant have since retracted or contradicted their trial testimony in sworn statements. nevertheless, a prisoner seeking to rely on revised witness testimony faces a high hurdle in the face of deference to the original jury verdict. at the june 2010 evidentiary hearing in us district court, the georgia prosecutor argued that every court in the united states at every level has said, recantations are not favoured, they are looked at with great scepticism, theyre unreliable. she concluded about the troy davis case: this was their chance. the standard is extremely high, they have not met it. one of the witnesses who appeared at the hearing was benjamin gordon, who in 2008 had signed a statement that an alternative suspect (a relative of his by marriage) had told him that he had shot officer macphail. at the hearing, benjamin gordon asserted for the first time that he had actually seen this individual shoot the police officer. benjamin gordon, who had just turned 16 at the time of the crime, again alleged that he had been coerced by police into signing a statement implicating davis. he said that he had not come forward sooner with the assertion about seeing who shot the officer out of fear, and that he had decided to come in today and just let the truth be known. judge moore concluded that benjamin gordon was not a credible witness. the international community has agreed safeguards for capital cases in those countries that still retain the death penalty. one of these concerns the burden of proof on the death penalty state: capital punishment may be imposed only when the guilt of the person charged is based upon clear and convincing evidence leaving no room for an alternative explanation of the facts. the extraordinarily high burden of proof chosen by judge moore is less protective than this. amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases, unconditionally, regardless of questions of guilt or innocence, the crime in question, or the method of execution. there have been 1,246 executions in the usa since judicial killing resumed there in 1977, including 12 so far this year. georgia currently does not have the drugs necessary to carry out a lethal injection after the drugs enforcement administration of the us department of justice seized sodium thiopental in the possession of the state in order to conduct an investigation into how it was obtained. it is not known how long this may delay an execution date being set. for further information on the troy davis case, see usa: unconscionable and unconstitutional: troy davis facing fourth execution date in two years, may

including tying them to chairs and making the boy eat his own vomit. when daniel cook was nine, his grandmother died and the two children went to live with their mother and her new husband. the children were subjected to further physical abuse, including beatings with a belt, and daniel was subjected to further sexual abuse by one of his older step-brothers. in addition, daniel cook experienced several suicide attempts by his mother who reportedly suffered from bipolar disorder. when daniel cook was 14 years old, his mother gave up custody of him and he was placed in a home for boys. there he was subjected to further sexual abuse by a house parent, who is currently serving a prison term for such crimes. daniel cook was also allegedly tied up and raped by other individuals at the home. he ran away on a number of occasions, and was eventually discharged from the home at the age of 16. at the age of 18 he enlisted in the us army reserve, but within three months had attempted suicide by overdose and was discharged. he made a number of suicide attempts in the following years and was placed in psychiatric hospitals on several occasions. during those years, he was variously diagnosed with schizophrenia, acute psychosis, alcohol addiction, passive aggressive personality, depression, and dependent personality disorder. in her 2010 declaration, the psychiatrist stated that, in her opinion, had mr. cook been allowed a proper mental health evaluation in preparation for sentencing, he would have been diagnosed with a variety of disorders, including ptsd, organic mental syndrome, and amphetamine delusional disorder. at the time of the crime, daniel cook and john matzke were using crystal methamphetamine, and had smoked marijuana and consumed large amounts of alcohol. daniel cook had also taken valium that day. amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases, unconditionally, regardless of the crime or the offender, or the method used to kill the prisoner. to end the death penalty is to abandon a degrading, destructive, diversionary and divisive public policy that is not consistent with widely held values. it not only runs the risk of irrevocable error, it is also costly, in social and psychological terms as well as to the public purse. it has not been proved to have a unique deterrent effect. it tends to be applied in a discriminatory way, on grounds of race and class. it diverts resources that could be better used to work against violent crime and assist those affected by it. the death penalty extends the suffering of the victims family to that of the condemned prisoner. there have been 1,243 executions in the usa since judicial killing resumed there in 1977, including nine so far this year. arizona has executed 24 people since resuming executions in 1992. twenty-two of them were put to death under a three-drug lethal injection process (sodium thiopental, pancuronium bromide, and potassium chloride) used in most us death penalty states to anesthetize, paralyze and kill the prisoner. a shortage of sodium thiopental resulting from the sole us manufacturers suspension of production of the drug and its decision earlier this year to withdraw from the market has led to us death penalty states looking to each other, to the federal government, and to sources overseas for solutions. arizona is one of the states that have obtained lethal injection drugs from a company in the united kingdom in recent months (see urgent action update, 28 october 2010, http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/amr51/101/2010/en. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: n   acknowledging the seriousness of the crime for which daniel wayne cook was sentenced to death;

be executed in ohio on 10 march. he was sentenced to death in 1995 for a murder committed during a robbery in 1994. chong hoon mah, a south korean immigrant to the usa, was shot and killed on 21 march 1994 during a robbery of one of the retail shops that he owned in toledo, ohio. johnnie baston was arrested after police received information that he was involved in the crime. he told police that he had participated in the robbery with an accomplice named ray, a high-ranking gang member, who was the gunman. however, police were never able to identify or locate this person, and came to believe that johnnie baston acted alone. he was charged, pleaded not guilty, and chose to be tried before a three-judge panel rather than a jury. the judges sentenced him to death on 27 february 1995, finding only one mitigating factor  his young age  and ruling that this was outweighed by the nature of the crime. johnnie baston has been on death row for 16 years, most of his adult life. at the time of the crime, he was just past his 20th birthday. he had been abandoned by his biological mother soon after he was born, and has never seen her since, his only communication with her being a letter from her after he was sent to death row. as a young boy, he was adopted by his aunt after she saw his bruising and malnourishment, evidence of a pattern of physical abuse and neglect in his first years at the hands of his father. at the clemency hearing before the ohio adult parole authority on 3 february 2011, his adoptive mother recalled that his parental abandonment had led to serious behavioural problems in his teenage years, culminating in her throwing him out of the home about a week before the crime. also at the clemency hearing was one of the prosecutors from the original trial. she said that chong mahs son had asked her to appear to reiterate the victims familys opposition to the execution of johnnie baston because of their respect for human life. last year she and another prosecutor signed sworn statements that the mah family had been opposed to the death penalty at the time of the trial as well. last month, chong mahs son also signed a statement that my family and i are opposed to mr baston being executed. a senior justice on the ohio supreme court has called for abolition of the states death penalty, describing it as a death lottery (see overleaf). by way of illustration, johnnie batsons clemency petition points to the case of another defendant who was tried in the same county (lucas county) for a comparable crime in 1994 (shooting of a store manager at close range during a robbery) and was sentenced to life imprisonment. the petition also pointed to the disproportionate number of death sentences passed against black defendants in lucas county. of the 21 death sentences passed there since 1981, in 16 cases the defendant was black, and in four cases white. the parole board voted 9-0 against recommending clemency. their recommendation is not binding on the governor. background information amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases, unconditionally. to end the death penalty is to abandon a degrading, destructive, diversionary and divisive public policy that is not consistent with widely held values. it not only runs the risk of irrevocable error, it is also costly, in social and psychological terms as well as to the public purse. it has not been proved to have a unique deterrent effect. it tends to be applied in a discriminatory way, on grounds of race and class. it diverts resources that could be better used to work against violent crime and assist those affected by it. the death penalty extends the suffering of the victims family to that of the condemned prisoner. public and political support for the death penalty has weakened in recent years, and the rate of death sentencing has declined. one possible factor contributing to this decline is the adoption across the us states of life without the possibility of parole. ohio adopted this as a sentencing option in 1996, a year after johnnie batsons trial. in the decade from 1990 to 1999, 127 death sentences were passed in ohio, at an average of nearly 13 per year. in the following decade, the 43 death sentences were passed in the state, at an average of just over four per year. in 2008, then senior us supreme court justice john paul stevens revealed that he had decided, after more than three decades on the countrys highest court, that the death penalty was a cruel waste of time. i have relied on my own experience, he wrote, in reaching the conclusion that the imposition of the death penalty represents the pointless and needless extinction of life with only marginal contributions to any discernible social or public purposes. in ohio, senior justice paul pfeifer of the state supreme court, who when he was a state legislator was a co-author of ohios death penalty statute enacted in 1981, wrote in january 2011: i helped craft the law, and i have helped enforce it. from my rather unique perspective, i have come to the conclusion that we are not well served by our ongoing attachment to capital punishment i ask: do we want our state government  and thus, by extension, all of us  to be in the business of taking lives in what amounts to a death lottery? i cant imagine thats something about which most of us feel comfortable. and, thus, i believe the time has come to abolish the death penalty in ohio. also in january, a former director of the ohio department of corrections, who witnessed 33 executions between 2001 and 2010, urged ohio officials to consider abolition of the death penalty. there have been 1,242 executions in the usa since judicial killing resumed there in 1977, including eight so far this year. ohio has executed 42 people since resuming executions in 1999. thirty-two of them were put to death under a three-drug lethal injection process (sodium thiopental, pancuronium bromide, and potassium chloride) used in most us death penalty states to anesthetize, paralyze and kill the prisoner. in november 2009 the ohio authorities responded to ongoing legal challenges to the three-drug procedure  and to events two months earlier when the states lethal injection team attempted and failed over the course of two hours to execute death row prisoner romell broom  by changing to a one-drug protocol whereby the condemned inmate would be injected with five grams of sodium thiopental, essentially an overdose of this anaesthetic. having executed 10 prisoners in this way between december 2009 and february 2011, but now faced with the nationwide sodium thiopental shortage after the only us supplier, hospira, ceased production of this drug, ohio has decided to switch to another barbiturate, pentobarbital. the execution of johnnie baston is due to become the first carried out in ohio with this drug. from late 2010, oklahoma turned to this drug as the substitute for sodium thiopental in its three-drug execution method. in january, the ohio authorities were contacted by the denmark-based pharmaceutical company lundbeck inc. the letter states: in the wake of the decision of hospira to cease production of sodium thiopental, which is used in the execution of prisoners, lundbeck has become aware that the state of ohio has now decided to use lundbecks product nembutal (pentobarbital sodium injection usp) for this purpose. lundbeck is adamantly opposed to the use of nembutal, or any other product for that matter, for the purpose of capital punishment [w]e urge you to discontinue the use of nembutal in the execution of prisoners in your state because it contradicts everything we are in business to do  provide therapies that improve peoples lives. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: n   acknowledging the seriousness of the crime for which johnnie baston was sentenced to death; n   calling on the governor to commute the death sentence and to work to lead ohio away from the death penalty. appeals to: governor of ohio governor john kasich riffe center, 30th floor, 77 south high street columbus, oh 43215-6117, usa",0,"johnnie baston"

arizona, usa, at 10am on 26 october. thirteen federal judges have argued that he should have had a hearing into his claim that he was inadequately represented at his 1990 trial. in 2007, the trial judge said that she would not have passed a death sentence if she had heard the mitigating evidence. chester dyer was found dead in his flat in phoenix on 15 december 1989. jeffrey landrigan was charged with the murder. he could not afford a lawyer, so the court appointed one to represent him  an attorney who had never worked on a death penalty case before. jeffrey landrigan rejected the prosecutors offer of a 20-year prison term in return for a guilty plea to second-degree murder. the jury convicted him of first-degree murder. for the sentencing phase of the 1990 trial, the defense lawyer had prepared only two witnesses to testify. one was jeffrey landrigans biological mother (who had abandoned him when he was six months old) and one was his former wife. however, jeffrey landrigan refused to allow either to testify. the judge sentenced him to death, although she found that he had not acted with premeditation. the lawyer had not presented, or sought to present, any expert testimony on jeffrey landrigans background. in 1998, a neuropsychologist concluded that a combination of inherited factors, prenatal exposure to drugs and alcohol, early parental rejection and troubled relationships with his adoptive family had severely impaired jeffrey landrigans ability to function in society. in 1999, a federal district court judge refused to hold an evidentiary hearing into the claim that the trial lawyer had been constitutionally ineffective by failing to investigate and present mitigating evidence of jeffrey landrigans background of deprivation and abuse. in 2005, by nine votes to two, the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit concluded that the district judge had abused her discretion by denying such a hearing. the majority concluded there was a reasonable probability that if the trial judge had heard the mitigating evidence that had been presented on appeal she would not have passed a death sentence (which the trial judge has herself since said). even the two judges who voted against ordering the district court to hold an evidentiary hearing agreed that the trial lawyers preparation for the sentencing fell below professional standards. in 2007, by five votes to four, the us supreme court overturned the ninth circuits ruling, on the grounds that jeffrey landrigan would not have allowed his lawyer to present any mitigating evidence that he might have uncovered. the four dissenting justices accused their colleagues of ""pure guesswork"". background information according to the evidence raised on appeal, jeffrey landrigans biological parents abused drugs and alcohol, and his teenage mother did so when pregnant with him. she abandoned him when he was six months old. his father was imprisoned around this time, and by the time of jeffrey landrigans trial, he was on death row in arkansas. the child was later adopted. his adoptive mother was also an alcoholic, and subjected him to emotional and physical abuse, including on one occasion hitting him so hard with a frying pan that it dented it. the boy began abusing drugs and alcohol from an early age. in 1998, a neuropsychologist concluded that a combination of inherited, prenatal, and early developmental factors had severely impaired jeffrey landrigans ability to function in a society that expects individuals to operate in an organized and adaptive manner, taking into account actions and consequences of their behavior and their impact on society and its individual members. in the 2007 supreme court ruling, the four dissenting justices noted, among other things, the trial lawyers failure to complete a mental health evaluation of his client, which we now know would have uncovered a serious organic brain disorder and his failure to consult an expert to explore the effects of [landrigans] birth mothers drinking and drug use during pregnancy. also in 2007, the now retired trial judge concluded that had she heard the mitigating evidence, especially the evidence of mr landrigans organic brain damage, the impact of fetal alcohol syndrome on his behavior, his genetic predispositions and the apparent abandonment by his birth mother, she would not have passed a death sentence. she emphasized that the neuropsychologists 1998 report would have left her with no choice but to find that the mitigating circumstances were sufficient to call for leniency. at the trial, the state argued that jeffrey landrigan and chester dyer had engaged in a violent struggle after having sex. the prosecution argued that these were the only two people present in the apartment on the night of the murder. dna testing since the trial has revealed that semen and blood from the crime scene were from two people, but excluded jeffrey landrigan as the source of either of the two dna profiles. this would suggest that the states theory of the crime presented to the jury was wrong. like most other us death penalty states, arizona uses three drugs for executions by lethal injection  pancuronium bromide, potassium chloride, and sodium thiopental. there is currently a nationwide shortage of sodium thiopental, resulting in delays in executions in at least two states, kentucky and oklahoma. the pharmaceutical company hospira is the sole manufacturer and distributor of sodium thiopental in the usa and it will reportedly not be able to make more of the drug available until march 2011 (in march 2010, hospira wrote to the ohio authorities to state its position that the companys products are meant to improve or save lives and that it does not support the use of any of our products in capital punishment procedures). authorities in california recently revealed that they had obtained the drug with an expiry date of 2014, indicating that it cannot be a product of hospira, whose last batch of sodium thiopental had expiry dates of 2011. on 8 october 2010, the director of the arizona department of corrections (adc) informed a state court that the department has lawfully obtained the necessary chemicals under its current written protocol  sodium thiopental, pancuronium bromide, and potassium chloride  in sufficient quantity for an execution. citing the recent developments in california among other things, jeffrey landrigans lawyers are seeking to have the state reveal the source of the sodium thiopental, including ensuring that it has not unknowingly obtained counterfeit or non-viable drugs, from inside or outside the usa, which could result in an unconstitutional execution. the state has responded that individuals or entities providing the necessary chemicals to adc are performing ancillary functions in the execution procedure, and this information is confidential. the litigation is continuing. amnesty international opposes the death penalty unconditionally in all cases.  the usa has carried out 1,230 executions since it resumed judicial killing in 1977, 42 of them this year (see also",0,"jeffrey landrigan"

executed in georgia, usa, at 9pm on 24 september. he was due to be put to death on the evening of 21 september, but his execution was stayed by the georgia supreme court after brandon rhode attempted suicide. brandon rhode was scheduled to be killed by lethal injection at 7pm on 21 september 2010. that morning, his lawyers filed a motion for an emergency stay of execution in the georgia supreme court. the lawyers had learned that brandon rhode had attempted suicide that morning and had been moved from death row for treatment at an undisclosed location. the motion stated that they had been given no information on their clients whereabouts, physical condition, mental condition, details of treatment, or drugs he may have ingested or been administered. effectively, brandon rhode was without counsel and without access to the courts and remedies on the day of his scheduled execution. the lawyers argued that brandon rhode could be incompetent for execution under us constitutional law, that is that he may not have a rational understanding of the reason for and reality of his punishment. they sought access to him and his medical and prison records. the state supreme court stayed the execution. according to the department of corrections the stay is until 2pm on 23 september and is to give the lawyers time to file a claim on brandon rhodes competence for execution. the original death warrant does not expire until 28 september, and the commissioner of corrections has reset the execution for 9pm on 24 september. brandon rhode was sentenced to death in february 2000 for the murder of steven moss and his two children, aged 11 and 15, committed during a burglary of their home, on 23 april 1998. his co-defendant daniel lucas was also sentenced to death and remains on death row without an execution date. brandon rhode was only 18 years old at the time of the crime. almost all his adult life has been spent in pre-trial custody and then death row. brandon rhodes background is one of deprivation, developmental problems, and substance abuse. an expert medical opinion concluded that has significantly impaired functioning due to exposure to alcohol as a foetus. on 17 september 2010, the georgia board of pardons and paroles denied clemency. background information according to the us supreme court, capital punishment must be limited to those offenders who commit a narrow category of the most serious crimes and whose extreme culpability makes them the most deserving of execution. in 1993, in the case of a death row prisoner who was 19 at the time of the crime, the court said that: youth is more than a chronological fact. it is a time and condition of life when a person may be most susceptible to influence and to psychological damage. a lack of maturity and an underdeveloped sense of responsibility are found in youth more often than in adults, and are more understandable among the young. these qualities often result in impetuous and ill-considered actions and decisions. in 1989, in another death penalty case, four supreme court justices had noted that age 18 is a necessarily arbitrary social choice as a point at which to acknowledge a persons maturity and responsibility, given the different developmental rates of individuals, and it is in fact a conservative estimate of the dividing line between adolescence and adulthood. many of the psychological and emotional changes that an adolescent experiences in maturing do not actually occur until the early 20s. in 2005, the supreme court finally ruled that offenders who were under 18 at the time of the crime should not be subjected to the death penalty. the decision noted that drawing the line at 18 years of age is subject, of course, to the objections always raised against categorical rules. the qualities that distinguish juveniles from adults do not disappear when an individual turns 18. brandon rhode was 18 years and nine months old at the time of the crime. brandon rhode was born in mississippi to a young mother, who as a 15-year-old was not even aware she was pregnant for the first five months. during this time she consumed alcohol and drugs. brandon rhode has been diagnosed as suffering from organic brain damage, and in 2010, using modern methods of testing, experts concluded that he definitely suffers from a fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (fasd), and that his development was significantly delayed as a result of his exposure to alcohol as a fetus. dr richard adler has said that what we now know for certain in 2010 is that the brain of a healthy child continues to grow and develop and mature into the early 20s. during that time, the executive functions of the brain  impulse control, judgment, planning, appreciation of consequences, empathy, ability to course-correct  are the last areas of brain functioning to develop. this is why adolescents  even 18 year old teenagers like brandon rhode was in 1998  are definitely impaired in these areas of functioning as compared to adults. furthermore, the characteristic deficits associated with fasd only exacerbate the impairments associated with adolescent brain immaturity in effect, brandon was functioning at a considerably younger level than his chronological age at the time of the subject crimes. brandon rhode began drinking alcohol at the age of 11, and by the age of 13 was abusing alcohol and drugs regularly. he was hospitalized at the age of 13 after a suicide attempt. at 15, he dropped out of school and was sent by his mother to live with his biological father who was a drug addict and alcoholic. the teenagers own substance abuse escalated and he began to burgle houses in the pursuit of money to buy alcohol and drugs in their emergency motion filed in the georgia supreme court, brandon rhodes lawyers have drawn attention to the fact that his best friend on death row, leeland braley, committed suicide in the cell next to him on 1 january 2010. also, on 19 november 2009 another inmate, timothy pruitt, was killed or committed suicide on the same tier of death row. in early 2010 amnesty international wrote to the prison authorities to express concern at the additional hardship and source of stress that recent changes to death row conditions  with reduced out-of-cell time and imposition of non-contact visits  would place on inmates. amnesty international opposes the death penalty unconditionally in all cases. the usa has carried out 1,226 executions since 1977. there have been 38 executions in the usa this year. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive

be executed in washington state, usa, on 10 september after over 16 years on death row. this would be the states first execution for nine years, its first non-consensual execution since 1994, and only its fifth execution since 1963. on 27 may 1991, police in washington state found the body of 21-year-old holly washa in the boot of her car. they were acting on information provided by police in california, who were themselves acting on statements given to them by cal brown, who had been arrested in california on suspicion of abducting, raping and attempting to kill another woman. in statements given to police, cal brown described abducting, robbing, raping, torturing and killing holly washa. he subsequently pled guilty to attempted murder in the california case and was sentenced to life imprisonment there. he was transferred to washington state, where he was tried for holly washas murder and sentenced to death on 28 january 1994. at capital jury selection in the usa, those citizens who would be irrevocably committed to vote against the death penalty can be excluded by the prosecution, under a 1968 us supreme court ruling. in 1985, the supreme court amended this standard to one where a prospective juror can be dismissed if his or her feelings about the death penalty would prevent or substantially impair the performance of his duties as a juror in accordance with his instructions and his oath. in 2006, the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit overturned cal browns death sentence on the grounds that a prospective juror had been unlawfully excluded at jury selection. the man in question had said that he believed the death penalty was appropriate in severe cases and that he would take into account mitigating and aggravating factors. most importantly, the ninth circuit noted, he promised he would follow the law without reservation.however, the state had objected to the juror on the grounds that he was too reluctant to impose the death penalty and the trial judge allowed the prosecution to exclude him. his exclusion, the ninth circuit court said, meant that browns death sentence cannot stand. in 2007, the us supreme court reinstated cal browns death sentence. it ruled that deference to the trial court is appropriate and that by not according the required deference, the court of appeals failed to respect the limited role of federal habeas relief in this area prescribed by congress and by our cases.four of the nine justices dissented, accusing the majority of choosing to defer blindly to a state courts mistake, and of upholding the disqualification of a juror whose only failing was to harbor some slight reservation in imposing the most severe of sanctions.they continued: the court has fundamentally redefined  or maybe just misunderstood  the meaning of substantially impaired and, in doing so, has gotten it horribly backwards. it appears to be under the impression that trial courts should be encouraging the inclusion of jurors who will impose the death penalty rather than only ensuring the exclusion of those who say that, in all circumstances, they cannot. background information in 1998, the un special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions expressed concern that in the usa, while the jury system was intended to represent the community as a whole, the community can hardly be represented when those who oppose the death penalty or have reservations about it seem to be systematically excluded from sitting as jurors. as early as 1986, the us supreme court had itself acknowledged evidence from numerous studies that the death qualification of capital jurors produces juries somewhat more conviction-prone than non- death-qualified juries.in 1998, a review of existing research indicated that a favorable attitude towards the death penalty translates into a 44 per cent increase in the probability of a juror favoring conviction.another expert review in 1998 concluded that death-qualified jurors, regardless of the standard, are more conviction-prone, less concerned with due process, and they are more inclined to believe the prosecution than are excludable jurors.in 2008, us supreme court justice john paul stevens, with more than 30 years experience on the court  (he retired earlier this year), said that the process of obtaining a death qualified jury is really a procedure that has the purpose and effect of obtaining a jury that is biased in favor of conviction.justice stevens authored the dissent in the cal brown case. the death penalty in washington state has come under scrutiny following the case of gary ridgway, who in 2003 avoided the death penalty in return for his confession to murdering 48 women. the fact that he would serve a life sentence, while others would be executed for crimes with far fewer victims has, as the state supreme court put it in 2006, caused many in our community to seriously question whether the death penalty can, in fairness, be proportional when applied to any other defendant.however, the court upheld the states death penalty. the five judges in the majority said that while they did not minimize the importance of this moral questionit is a question best left to the people and to their elected representatives in the legislature.four dissenting judges argued that when gary ridgway, the worst mass murderer in this state's history, escapes the death penalty, serious flaws become apparent if the ridgway case was the only case at the far end of the spectrum, perhaps his penalty of life in prison rather than death could be explained or dismissed. ridgway, however, is not the only case in which a mass murderer escaped death.the dissenters went on to list other such cases which they said exemplify the arbitrariness with which the penalty of death is exacted. the death penalty is like lightning, randomly striking some defendants and not others... no rational explanation exists to explain why some individuals escape the penalty of death and others do not. there have been four executions in washington state since the usa resumed judicial killing in 1977. its first execution was in 1993, which was the first execution in the state since 1963. the last person to be executed was james ellege in august 2001. like three of the four men put to death in the state since 1977, ellege had given up his appeals and volunteered for execution.  the last non-consensual execution in washington state was that of charles campbell, hanged in may 1994. cal brown is one of eight men on death row in washington state. washington states current method of execution is lethal injection. earlier this year, the department of corrections abandoned its three-drug method and adopted a new, one-drug protocol. under the old method, sodium thiopental (an anesthetic), pancuronium bromide (a paralytic agent) and potassium chloride (a heart-attack inducing agent) were used to kill the prisoner. under the new protocol, the inmate is killed with a single large dose (five grams) of sodium thiopental. on 29 july 2010, the state supreme court dismissed as moot a lawsuit that had been brought by death row inmates challenging the three-drug method. cal browns lawyers are seeking a stay of execution in order to challenge the new lethal injection method. amnesty international opposes the death penalty unconditionally in all cases, regardless of the crime or the method used to kill the prisoner. the usa has carried out 1,224 executions since 1977. there have been 36 executions in the usa this year. recommended action:

american man who has significant mental impairments, is due to be executed in alabama on 9 september. four federal judges on three courts have concluded that he was denied adequate legal representation at the sentencing stage of his 1994 trial. holly woods former girlfriend, ruby lois gosha, the mother of their son, was shot in her home on 1 september 1993. a jury convicted holly wood of her murder on 21 october 1994. at the sentencing hearing, holly wood was represented by a lawyer who had been admitted to the bar five months earlier, had no trial or criminal law experience, and had never worked on a capital case before. alabama law required that lawyers appointed to capital cases had at least five years experience in criminal law. the novice lawyer was appointed to assist the two senior lawyers on the case, but they delegated the penalty phase to him and effectively abandoned him. the presentation of mitigating evidence at the sentencing was minimal. in particular, there was no evidence at all presented about holly woods mental ability despite the lawyers being in possession of an expert report indicating that wood operated, at most, in the borderline range of intellectual functioning. because of the novice lawyers inadequate investigation, the fact that as a child holly wood had been in special education classes for children with low iq scores was not investigated or presented to the jury. the us supreme court has recognized that impaired intellectual functioning is inherently mitigating (2004) and has said that evidence that a capital defendant is borderline mentally retarded, might well influence[e] the jurys appraisal of his moral culpability (2000). by a vote of 10-2, the jury voted to recommend the death penalty. another vote against death would have resulted in a life sentence. the vote was split along racial lines, with the two black jurors voting for life imprisonment and the 10 whites voting for execution. blacks had been disproportionately removed by the prosecution during jury selection. the judge accepted the jury recommendation and sentenced holly wood to death on 9 december 1994, finding that there were no mitigating circumstances. the alabama courts upheld the death sentence. however, in 2006 senior us district court judge harold albritton ruled that holly wood had been denied his right to effective assistance of counsel at the sentencing, and ordered that he be resentenced to life in prison, or given a new sentencing hearing. in 2008, the court of appeals for the 11th circuit overturned the ruling, citing the highly deferential standards to be given to state court decisions by the federal judiciary. one of the three judges dissented, citing the egregious failures and sheer neglect of the trial lawyers. in 2010, the us supreme court upheld the 10th circuit decision. two justices dissented, arguing that the failure of the trial lawyers to investigate woods mental disability was the product of inattention and neglect. background information at the sentencing phase of holly woods trial, the defense case consisted of testimony from his father and two of his sisters. the novice lawyer met with them for the first time at the courthouse during the guilt phase of the trial (the sentencing phase began a day after the guilt phase ended). according to us district court judge albritton, the mitigation testimony amounted to little more than a plea for juror sympathy. substantial mitigating evidence about holly woods background of poverty and deprivation and his upbringing in an environment dominated by alcohol was not presented. neither was evidence of whippings to which he was subjected by his mother, and after she died when he was about 10 years old, the regular severe beatings with an extension cord he received at the hands of his adult stepsister who became his caregiver. however, it was the utter failure of the defense counsel to present any evidence of his mental impairment that has divided the federal courts on his case. in 2002, the us supreme court ruled, in atkins v. virginia, that the execution of offenders with mental retardation was prohibited. the atkins ruling pointed to professional definitions of such disability, but left it to the individual states to take appropriate steps to enforce the ban. in alabama, in the absence of a legislative response to the atkins ruling, the state court of criminal appeals said in 2006 that for a defendant to be considered to have mental retardation, he or she must have significantly sub-average intellectual functioning (an iq of 70 or below), and significant or substantial deficits in adaptive behavior (and these problems must have manifested themselves before the individual was 18 years old). lawyers for holly wood raised an atkins claim, but after an evidentiary hearing in 2003, a state court decided that he did not have mental retardation and upheld his death sentence. in their appeal to the federal district court, holly woods lawyers maintained that it was uncontested that his iq was below 70 (during post-conviction proceedings, psychologists had assessed his iq at 64 and 59), that he had significant limitations in one area of adaptive functioning, namely functional academic skills (e.g. reading), and that these deficits had manifested before he was 18 years old. the case therefore turned on whether he had adaptive deficits in more than one area. the state argued successfully during the appeals process that he does not. the fact that holly woods death sentence has been upheld has relied on federal judicial deference to state court decisions. in this case, the state courts found that the defense counsel had made a strategic choice not to present the mental impairment evidence. in his 2006 decision, judge albritton wrote that he had found nothing in the record to even remotely support a finding that counsel made a strategic decision not to let the jury at the penalty phase know about woods mental condition. in overturning this decision, the two 11th circuit judges emphasized that their role under federal law was not to determine anew whether the defense lawyers were ineffective or whether wood was prejudiced by their ineffectiveness, but whether under the general framework of substantial deference for reviewing state court rulings, the latter had been unreasonable. they ruled that they had not. in the 2010 us supreme court decision, the two dissenting justices argued that the only reasonable factual conclusion to be drawn from the record was that the defense lawyers failure to present the evidence was the result of inattention and neglect, which is the antithesis of a strategic choice. indeed, they said, the decision not to carry out any investigation into woods mental disability, even though the lawyers were in possession of an expert report that indicated his possible mental retardation, was so obviously unreasonable that the decision itself is highly persuasive evidence that counsel did not have any strategy in mind when they did so. amnesty international unconditionally opposes the death penalty. the usa has carried out 1,224 executions since resuming judicial killing in 1977. alabama accounts for 47 of these executions. there have been 36 executions in the usa this year, three of them in alabama. recommended action:

2. passive-dependent personality features; and 3. drug dependence it is my opinion that these limitations made it highly unlikely that she was capable of the initiation and planning of the crime at the time of the crimes, her judgment was severely impaired by her disabilities and her addiction, and she would have been subject to being easily led by others. she also concluded that teresa lewiss abuse of and addiction to prescription drugs could have explained her perceived lack of remorse at the time of the crimes, a factor which has been cited by the prosecution and the courts in justification of the death sentence. the psychiatrist said that it seems clear that ms lewis has tremendous guilt and remorse about her actions. she is currently being treated for post-traumatic stress disorder with medication and psychotherapy. she states that she continues to have frequent flashbacks to the event, dreams about it, and continues to have insomnia and thoughts at the time of sleep about these events. she is tearful in describing the night of the murder and in describing the impact on her family, particularly her son. also in 2004, another mental health expert, a professor of psychology at duke university, north carolina, provided his opinion. he concluded that when multiple sources of evidence are taken into account, it is very clear that teresa possessed neither the verbal intelligence nor the independent initiative to frame and mastermind a plan to murder the victims. it is also quite inconsistent with both tested personality profiles and patterns of personality evidenced in her life choices that teresa would lead and direct two men in the commission of these crimes. teresa spent her life taking orders from men and complying with their wishes in order to please them from a psychological standpoint, a woman who is functionally retarded intellectually, with passive dependent personality disturbance, and a habit of submissively seeking mens approval throughout her life, is a poor bet as the mastermind of a brutal murder plot.  in relation to the iq assessment made at the time of her sentencing, he said: in pragmatic terms, the level of intellectual functioning of one with a 72 iq would not be discernibly distinctive from one with a 69 iq. certainly, it would not be professionally reasonable to base a life or death decision on three iq points (the execution of people with mental retardation is prohibited in the usa  an iq of 70 or lower is an indicator of possible mental retardation). the trial court held a post-conviction evidentiary hearing at which this evidence was presented. the state presented an evaluation presented by another mental health expert who rejected the diagnosis of dependent personality disorder and of teresa lewiss addiction to prescription drugs. he concluded that teresa lewis had the mental capacity to plan and carry out the murder plot. the judge upheld the death sentence, and the appeal courts have affirmed this decision. for the past seven years, teresa lewis, who is the only woman on death row in virginia, has been housed in the segregation unit at fluvanna correctional center for women (a move unrelated to any disciplinary issues). she spends virtually all her time alone in her cell. when she is allowed outside for recreation, she is by herself.  she can hear and converse with other inmates who are placed in the segregation unit temporarily as punishment for disciplinary problems or disruptive behavior in the general population of the facility.  she also is allowed to meet periodically with the prison chaplain. amnesty international unconditionally opposes the death penalty, in all cases and in all countries. the usa has carried out 1,224 executions  of 1213 men (99 per cent) and 11 women  since resuming judicial killing in 1977. virginia accounts for 107 of these executions. the last woman put to death in virginia was virginia christian who was killed in the states electric chair on 11 august 1912 for a murder committed when she was 17 years old. the last woman put to death in the usa was frances newton in texas in september 2005. there have been 36 executions in the usa this year, two of them in virginia. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: - explaining that you are not seeking to excuse the killing of julian and charles lewis;

15 june for the murder of a police officer committed more than three decades ago. david powell, who was 27 years old at the time of the crime, is now aged 59. officer ralph ablanedo was shot dead in the state capital, austin, in may 1978. david powell was convicted of his murder in october 1978. he was sentenced to death according to texas law, which stipulates that in order for such a sentence to be passed, a jury must decide that it is probable that he would commit future acts of criminal violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society. in 1989, the us supreme court overturned the conviction and death sentence (see over). david powell was retried in 1991 and again sentenced to death. in 1994, this sentence was overturned by the texas court of criminal appeals because of an error in the judge's instructions to the jury. in 1999, a new sentencing hearing was held. as evidence of david powells future dangerousness, the prosecution relied primarily on the facts of the crime committed over two decades earlier. it also presented evidence that in 1970, when powell was a teenager (he was now approaching 50), he had stolen a car and used false identification. the prosecution also sought to boost its case by pointing to evidence that he had broken rules in prison: all were minor infractions spread thinly over the years since his conviction, such as having an extra pair of socks and shorts in his cell; not making his bed before 6am; playing his radio too loud; cursing at a guard when he was not allowed to have contact lens solution; and refusing to obey an order to remove a poster from the wall of his cell. the defense presented evidence that before david powell started using drugs at university, he had been a law-abiding promising student. his drug use led to increasing paranoia and irrational behavior, leading up to the crime. after he stopped using drugs, once he was in prison, he returned to something like his former self, and several prison guards testified that he was a model inmate. nevertheless, the jury decided that he would pose a danger to society if allowed to live, even in prison, and sentenced him to death for a third time. his current lawyer has told amnesty international that david powell is not the same person he was in may 1978. he is now (and has been for a long time) remorseful, humble, steadfastly non-violent, and a positive role-model. in 1999, a us supreme court judge wrote that the longer the delay between conviction and execution, the weaker the justification for imposing the death penalty in terms of punishments basic retributive and deterrent purposes. in 2002, the same judge noted that the uncertainty and lengthy delays between sentencing and execution can inflict horrible feelings and an immense mental anxiety amounting to a great increase of the offenders punishment. background information in may 1978, david powell asked his former girlfriend sheila meinert to drive him from austin to the city of killeen to conduct a drug deal. in the car was a large quantity of drugs, a handgun and an ak-47 rifle, both loaded, and a hand grenade. they were stopped by officer ralph ablanedo when he noticed the vehicle had no rear license plate. he gave sheila meinert a traffic ticket and radioed in to see if there were any arrest warrants outstanding against them. he allowed them to drive off before the check was completed because the dispatcher informed him that the computer system was malfunctioning. the message then came back that there was an arrest warrant against david powell (for theft), and officer ablanedo pulled sheila meinerts car over again. as he approached, he was shot from the back of the car. prior to david powells trial, the judge ordered that he be subjected to a psychiatric examination to assess his competence to stand trial and his sanity at the time of the crime. the defense was not told that the experts would assess the defendants future dangerousness, and david powell himself had not been advised that he could remain silent. yet both experts testified at the trial that, based on their examinations, they believed that david powell would commit acts of future violence. in 1989, the us supreme court overturned the death sentence, noting that for a defendant charged with a capital crime, the decision whether to submit to a psychiatric examination designed to determine his future dangerousness is literally a life or death matter which the defendant should not be required to face without the guiding hand of counsel. according to david powells current lawyer, at the 1991 trial, scores of police marched into the courtroom with black ribbons over their badges. the austin police association (apa) continues to support david powells execution. on 18 may 2008, the 30th anniversary of officer ablanedos death, the apa took out a full page advertisement in the austin american-statesman newspaper announcing that david powells federal appeal in the us court of appeals for the fifth circuit court would be heard in new orleans on 3 june 2008. after the hearing, attended by about 25 austin police officers, the apa president was quoted in the newspaper as saying hopefully this last appeal will be done and we can move on with setting an execution date so we can move on and the family of ralph ablanedo can finally get closure. today, the apa website carries the news of david powells execution date and that the apa has chartered a bus for friends and fellow police officers wishing to travel to huntsville on the day of the execution. the apa advertisement of 18 may 2008 also included the assertion that on the day of his death, officer ablanedo had returned fire with nine shots. until then, the states case had been that he had not fired his gun before he was shot by david powell. no trial witness had ever testified that the officer fired his weapon. powells lawyers filed a new habeas corpus petition on this issue, arguing that such information might have altered the sentencing outcome, and might provide evidence about the involvement of sheila meinert in the shooting. the texas court of criminal appeals summarily denied the petition in september 2009. amnesty international unconditionally opposes the death penalty, in all cases and in all countries. the usa has carried out 1,206 executions since resuming judicial killing in 1977. texas accounts for 456 of these executions. there have been 18 executions in the usa this year, nine of them in texas. today 139 countries are abolitionist in law or practice. more than 70 countries have legislated to abolish the death penalty since david powell was first sent to death row. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible (include inmate no: #000612): - explaining that you are not seeking to excuse the killing of austin police officer ralph ablanedo; - noting that more than three decades have passed since the crime,

be executed by firing squad in the us state of utah on 18 june. condemned to death for killing a lawyer during an escape attempt in 1985, he has been on death row for almost a quarter of a century. the last execution in utah was in 1999. on 2 april 1985, 24-year-old ronnie gardner was being led into a court building in salt lake city for a hearing on a second degree murder charge when a female accomplice handed him a gun. an exchange of gunfire with guards ensued, during which ronnie gardner was shot in the chest. wounded, he entered the archives room, inside which was a court clerk, a prison officer, and three lawyers. he fatally shot one of the lawyers, michael burdell, before fleeing the room and the building. he was surrounded by police in the car park, and surrendered. he was tried in october 1985 and sentenced to death for the first-degree murder of michael burdell. after holding an evidentiary hearing in november 1990, a state court judge ruled in 1991 that ronnie gardner had been denied adequate legal representation at the sentencing stage of his trial, including as a result of the defense counsel's failure to investigate and present mitigating evidence to the jury. he ordered a new sentencing hearing. however, the utah supreme court overturned the decision, ruling that errors by the lawyers had not been shown to have prejudiced ronnie gardner's trial. the state had denied gardner funding to retain expert witnesses, but he received this funding once the case went into the federal courts. mitigating evidence not fully provided to the jury was presented to the federal courts, relating to ronnie gardner's deprived and abusive background, together with expert neurological and psychiatric evidence of organic brain damage resulting in cognitive and intellectual deficits and impulse control problems. in 2009, the us court of appeals for the 10th circuit noted that ""it is undisputed that mr. gardners childhood was troubled in many respects,"" and added that ""reasonable minds may differ on the likely impact on the jury of more thoroughly researched mental health testimony."" however, noting that the question before it when applying the deference due to state court decisions by federal courts under us law was ""not whether the utah supreme court was correct but whether its judgment was unreasonable."" the 10th circuit panel concluded that it was not unreasonable. on 4 may 2010, lawyers filed a clemency petition to the utah board of pardons and parole requesting that the death sentence be commuted to life imprisonment. they have submitted declarations from those close to michael burdell, including his fiance and his 86-year-old father, who maintain that he would not have wanted ronnie gardner to be put to death. the board has not yet said whether it will hold a clemency hearing. background information amnesty international opposes the death penalty unconditionally, in all cases and in all countries, regardless of the method used to kill the prisoner, or the nature of the crime for which he or she was sentenced to death. the usa has carried out 1,203 executions since resuming judicial killing in 1977. utah accounts for six of these executions, including the first carried out in the usa after the 1976 supreme court decision that allowed executions to resume: gary gilmore was shot by a utah firing squad on 17 january 1977 after refusing to appeal against his death sentence. three of the five men executed in utah since then have also been so-called ""volunteers"" who waived appeals and ""consented"" to execution. the execution of ronnie gardner would be the first in utah since 1999 and the first ""non-consensual"" execution there since 1992. ronnie gardner has chosen to be put to death by firing squad rather than lethal injection. according to the evidence presented during ronnie gardners federal appeals, his childhood was one of abuse and deprivation: his mother suffered from mental illness, the familys economic circumstances were dire, the children were neglected. the family household was marked by criminality, violence and abuse. ronnie gardner suffered meningitis as a child, resulting in possible brain damage. he developed a severe tic, possibly tourette syndrome. he was sexually abused by an older brother, and later by the man who became his foster carer. he began engaging in substance abuse, such as sniffing paint thinner, from the age of five or six and carried on until he was 18, and was introduced to lsd, marijuana, and alcohol before the age of 10. his stepfather involved him in criminal acts, taking him to wyoming to steal liquid mercury from oil industry facilities. ronnie gardner sustained a number of serious head injuries during his childhood. in a brief filed in may 2010 in state court, his lawyers stated: ""the jury convicted mr. gardner of an intentional killing and sentenced him to death without hearing all these facts. they never heard about the terrible conditions and the moral depravity in the environment of his upbringing. the jury never heard about the physical and sexual abuse and criminality in the household. none of the jurors knew anything about the meningitis, head injuries, inhalant, alcohol and drug abuse, the tic, organic brain syndrome, cognitive and intellectual deficits, impulse disorder, hard signs and radiological evidence of the brain damage."" those supporting clemency include michael burdell's father and his fiance, as well as a close friend who was at the courthouse with michael burdell on the day he was shot. his 86-year-old father signed a sworn statement on 19 april 2010 that: ""i do not believe gardner should be executed. i do not believe my son, michael burdell, would want gardner to be executed. i do not believe gardner should be executed because i do not believe the murder was premeditated. gardner himself had been shot and his shooting my son was a spur of the moment reaction. furthermore, i do not believe gardner is the same person today that he was in 1985. my son was a caring and generous person who tried to help others. it would not have been in his nature to condone gardners execution. he would not have approved of it at all. the fiance states: michael burdell would not have wanted ronnie lee gardner put to death. there is absolutely no question about this in my mind. the friend who was with michael burdell in the courthouse when he was shot, has emphasized that michael burdell was a pacifist who lived his convictions, and i am certain that he would not want ronnie lee gardner to be put to death."" ronnie gardner has been on death row for nearly 25 years, more than half of his life. in 1999, a us supreme court justice wrote that the longer the delay between conviction and execution, ""the weaker the justification for imposing the death penalty in terms of punishments basic retributive and deterrent purposes."" in 2002, the same justice noted that the uncertainty and lengthy delays between sentencing and execution ""can inflict horrible feelings and an immense mental anxiety amounting to a great increase of the offenders punishment."" recommended

full evidence of ronnie lee gardner's deprived and abusive childhood, and noting further evidence raised since the trial of brain damage and its possible effects on his conduct; n   noting that ronnie

and his sentence should be changed to lifethis was a crime fuelled by drugs, and mr smith had no intent to take my brothers life. since the trial, rita cagle has said that on the night of the crime, there was a struggle for the gun between [smith and john cederlund], and during the struggle the gun went off and [cederlund] was shot. i cannot say for sure whether [smith] shot [cederlund] on purpose or not. according to the reports of the psychologist and neuro-pharmacologist hired during smiths appeals, richard smiths father was in prison for the first eight years of his sons life, and after his release used to engage in physical fights with the boy, as well as teaching him to shoplift, steal cars and burgle houses. his mother remarried, but her husband was physically violent towards his stepson. at the age of 11 or 12, richard smith ran away from home, was apprehended by the authorities and sent to a juvenile facility, where he attempted suicide rather than be sent home. upon being returned home, he was beaten by his stepfather and for two weeks was handcuffed and locked in a cupboard each night at bedtime. at the age of 12, richard smith went to live with his father, and took to alcohol and substance abuse, and witnessed his father intravenously injecting amphetamines. in subsequent years, he was shuttled between his mother, father and other relatives, living in five states and attending over a dozen schools. richard smith began using marijuana at the age of eight, and later took to huffing glue and gasoline. by 14 or 15, he was injecting methamphetamine four times a day, smoking marijuana, and taking injections of cocaine mixed with methamphetamine twice a week, as well as drinking whisky. at 17, he began to inject heroin together with either methamphetamine or cocaine. he also took to using lsd, injecting it intravenously. as part of the post-conviction assessment, richard smith was diagnosed with chronic schizophrenia, and ascertained to have suffered multiple head injuries. according to the psychologist, richard smith did not receive adequate treatment during his youth, and his mental illness was exacerbated by his drug and alcohol use, and probable brain damage. she concluded that at the time of the crime, his ability to conform his conduct to the law was likely very impaired. in the us district court ruling on the case in 2005, the judge ruled that, by todays standards, the failure by richard smiths trial lawyer to request funds for or the appointment of a psychiatrist to assist him at the penalty phase of the trial was not objectively reasonable. however, the judge upheld the death sentence, saying that under the state of the law in 1987 he could not rule that the lawyers failure was professionally unreasonable at that time. three jurors from the trial have said that if lwop had been an option at the trial, they would have voted for it, not for death. a fourth has stated that he believes lwop is the appropriate sentence in this case. two others have said that they would not oppose his death sentence being commuted to lwop. two of these jurors recalled that they had been unimpressed by the defense lawyers performance at the trial, with one referring to the meaningless case he presented at the sentencing. another recalled his feeling that the states two key witnesses  pamela rutledge and rita cagle  were accomplices in the crime and that it was not an open and shut case, where richard smiths guilt was clear. another noted all the news lately about wrongful convictions and that she now had serious concerns about the state executing mr smith, who was not among the worst of the worst offenders or responsible for the worst of the worst crimes for which the us death penalty is supposed to be reserved. amnesty international unconditionally opposes the death penalty, in all cases and in all countries. the usa has carried out 1,198 executions since resuming judicial killing in 1977. oklahoma accounts for 92 of these executions. per head of population, oklahoma has the highest execution rate in the usa. there have been 10 executions in the usa this year. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: n   explaining that you are not seeking to excuse the killing of john cederlund;

the 1993 murder of his girlfriend and her two sons in the house all four shared. he maintains his innocence and is seeking clemency and dna testing of evidence from the crime. at around midnight on 31 december 1993, police in pampa, texas, found elwin caler, 22, sitting on the porch of his neighbors house with a fatal stab wound. he died without identifying his assailant. next door, the police found the body of elwin calers mother, twila busby, who had had been strangled and bludgeoned to death. her other son, randy busby, 20, had been stabbed in his bed. about three hours later, police arrested twila busbys boyfriend, henry skinner, in the home of his former girlfriend, andrea reed, a short distance away. he had a deep cut on his hand, and had blood on his clothes, including blood which was found to be from twila busby and elwin caler. henry skinner pleaded not guilty at his 1995 trial, with his lawyers presenting the theory that he had been physically unable to commit the crimes and that the police had ignored a plausible alternative suspect. the defense presented a toxicologist who testified that, in his opinion, it was highly improbable that henry skinner could have committed the murders because of his level of intoxication with alcohol and codeine on the night in question. the state presented no expert evidence to rebut this testimony, suggesting instead that his history of drug and alcohol abuse made him tolerant to such substances. the defense also presented expert testimony that a hand injury henry skinner had sustained a few months earlier had left him without the strength required to have inflicted twila busbys severe injuries. nevertheless, the jury voted to convict henry skinner and sentence him to death. the case against henry skinner remains circumstantial, showing only that he was present at the scene of the murders, a fact that he has never disputed. since the trial, further evidence pointing to the possible alternative suspect has emerged, and andrea reed, whom the state used as a key prosecution witness, has recanted parts of her trial testimony (see overleaf). the nationally-renowned medill innocence project at northwestern university in illinois  whose work has contributed to the release of 11 wrongfully convicted prisoners in the usa, including five on death row  has investigated the case and concluded that henry skinners guilt is questionable at best, and in fact he may well be innocent. the projects director, professor david protess, has written to the texas board of pardons and paroles that in more than twenty years of investigating and researching possible wrongful convictions, i have rarely seen a case this circumstantial and shaky in which the prisoner was actually guilty. henry skinner continues to seek dna testing of evidence from the crime which he maintains could point to another person as the murderer. the items include vaginal swabs and fingernail clippings taken from twila busby, biological material on a windbreaker jacket that was found next to her body and on two knives found at the scene. background information according to evidence at the 1995 trial, at about 10.30pm on 31 december 1993, howard mitchell went to the home of twila busby and henry (hank) skinner to take them to a party. howard mitchell was unable to wake henry skinner, who had passed out intoxicated on a sofa. at the trial, howard mitchell described henry skinner as having been completely unconscious and kind of comatose (that is, within an hour and a half of the murders). howard mitchell and twila busby went to the party, but he dropped her home within an hour, after she complained of being sexually harassed at the party by her uncle, robert donnell. at the trial, the defence argued that robert donnell (who was killed in a car crash in 1997) was a plausible alternative suspect who was never investigated by the police due to the focus on henry skinner. in 1997 howard mitchell made a sworn statement saying that about four months before her death, twila busby had told him that robert donnell had been making sexual advances towards her and that he had even tried to rape her. at a federal court hearing in 2005, a neighbor of robert donnell testified that a couple of days after the murders, she had seen him thoroughly clean the inside of his truck and then paint the outside of it. she said that this conduct was out of the ordinary, as she had never seen him clean the vehicle before. she said that robert donnell wore a windbreaker jacket all the time (apparently similar to that found at the crime scene), and she and other witnesses at the hearing testified that he always carried a knife, and had threatened people with it. at the trial, the prosecution introduced a statement henry skinner gave to investigators three days after his arrest in which he said he remembered little after falling asleep on the sofa. it also presented andrea reed, who testified that at about midnight on the night in question, skinner had come to her trailer and told her a series of inconsistent stories about what had happened, including that he thought that he might have kicked twila busby to death (there was no evidence that she had been kicked). she said that henry skinner had threatened to kill her if she called the police. in 1997, she recanted parts of her trial testimony. she said that he had not threatened to kill her, and that he had been far more intoxicated than her trial testimony indicated. she said that she had lied because she was afraid of being arrested herself and of her young daughter being forced to testify. she said: the lies that i told to protect myself made it appear as if hank broke into my house, held me hostage and confessed to the murders. the truth is that i invited a harmless drunk into my house and listened to three hours of meaningless gibberish. the appeal courts have upheld the death sentence over a period of 15 years. in his letter to the texas clemency board, professor protess recalls the case of anthony porter, another which the medill innocence project investigated. anthony porter had been on death row for more than 16 years in illinois, his conviction and sentence upheld by the courts. fifty hours from execution in 1999, he received a stay. the project then uncovered anthony porters wrongful conviction and he was subsequently released. the us death penalty system has repeatedly been shown to be capable of error. since 1976, more than 130 people have been released from death rows around the country on the grounds of innocence. since 1989, dna testing has contributed to the exoneration of more than more than 200 people convicted of criminal offences in the usa, including 17 on death row. some prisoners have gone to their execution despite serious doubts about their guilt. they include cameron willingham, executed in texas in 2004 despite expert evidence that the fire which killed the victims was accidental rather than the result of arson. amnesty international unconditionally opposes the execution of henry skinner, regardless of his guilt or innocence, as it does all executions. the usa has carried out 1,194 executions since resuming judicial killing in 1977. texas accounts for 449 of these executions (see too much cruelty, too little clemency: texas nears 200th execution under current

in the us state of florida at 6pm on 16 february for a crime committed when he was 19 years old. he was convicted of murder in 1985, and has been on death row for nearly a quarter of a century. margaret park, a 26-year-old woman employed as a wildlife officer by the state game and fish commission, was shot dead while on patrol in coastal mid-western florida on 13 december 1984. about two weeks later, 19-year-old martin grossman and thayne taylor, aged 17, were arrested (see overleaf). the two were tried jointly. grossman was convicted of first-degree murder. taylor was convicted of third-degree murder, a non-capital offence. at the sentencing for martin grossman, the defense presented four witnesses  the defendants mother, a childhood friend, and two correctional staff  in an attempt to portray his positive attributes to counter the facts of the crime on which the state was relying to obtain a death sentence. however, the jury voted for death, the judge accepted its recommendation, rejected grossmans young age as a mitigating factor, and determined that there were no mitigating factors. the aggravating factors were held to include that the murder was committed to avoid arrest and that it was especially wicked, evil, atrocious or cruel. the appeal courts have rejected the claim that grossman received inadequate representation at the sentencing phase. in an affidavit, grossman's lead trial lawyer said that he and his defense colleague had done a very poor and ineffective job. upholding the death sentence in 2005, however, a federal judge ruled that this view was premised on the benefit of hindsight. the second defense lawyer, who had been hired only two weeks before the sentencing to prepare mitigation evidence, stated that they should have told the trial judge that they were not ready. the defense presented no expert mental health testimony, after their court-appointed psychologist told them that his assessment of grossman had uncovered no problems serious enough to aid their defense. however, a forensic psychologist hired by martin grossman's lawyers several years after his conviction drew a different conclusion after a more thorough assessment. he concluded that there was much mental health evidence that called into question the notion that martin grossman had acted in premeditated fashion at the time of the crime or that should serve as mitigating evidence. martin grossman had ""compromised intellectual functioning, probable brain dysfunction"", and a developmental history characterized by profound and untreated complicated bereavement  (including as a result of the death in 1981 of his father, during whose long and serious illness martin had acted as primary care-giver)  a high level of fear and depression, and parental neglect, abandonment and mistreatment. background information according to the trial record, martin grossman and thayne taylor had driven to a wooded area on the night of 13 december 1984 to shoot a handgun that grossman had recently obtained. the two teenagers were confronted by margaret park who found the gun and began to radio the police. martin grossman, who was on probation at the time following a burglary conviction, pleaded with her not to turn him in as it would mean going back to prison. when she refused, he grabbed her torch and repeatedly struck her with it, with taylor coming to his assistance. margaret park managed to draw her gun, and fire off a shot before martin grossman grabbed the weapon and fired a single shot which struck the officer in the head. about two weeks later, grossman and taylor were arrested after an acquaintance, brian allan, told the police that they had admitted to the crime. the two had also apparently told another friend, brian hancock, of the shooting, and martin grossman also allegedly related the details of the shooting to a jail mate, charles brewer. the two defendants were tried jointly, over the objection of martin grossmans lawyer. the prosecution introduced the testimony of allan, hancock and brewer against grossman. it introduced against thayne taylor the statement that taylor had given to the police. the jury was instructed that it could only use it against taylor, not grossman. while the courts have ruled that it was a constitutional error against grossman to admit taylors statement in this way, they have ruled that the error was harmless given the other testimony pointing to grossmans dominant role in the crime. in 1990, charles brewer signed an affidavit retracting his trial testimony against grossman. he said that he assisted the authorities because he believed they would help him with his own case. he said that the authorities had told him to continue talking to grossman and had fed him questions to ask. among other things, brewer had testified that grossman had told him that he had shot margaret park because he did not want to be arrested by a woman. in his affidavit, he said that the prosecutors emphasized to him the female officer thing when they were preparing him to testify. during the trial, the prosecution had repeatedly emphasized the suggestion that gender had been part of the motive for the killing. in his affidavit, charles brewer said that i cannot say martin told me that and martin never said he shot her. on 14 january 2010, the florida supreme court overturned the death sentence of another inmate, paul johnson, after finding that the state had induced him to make incriminating statements to a jailhouse informant, and because the prosecutor had known the statements were impermissibly elicited and yet had introduced them at the 1988 trial. on 21 january 2010, a florida judge rejected the argument that grossman should receive the same relief as johnson, on the grounds that there was no evidence that the state knew brewers testimony was false at the time of grossmans trial. this and other issues are currently on appeal to the florida supreme court. amnesty international opposes the death penalty unconditionally. to end the death penalty is to abandon a destructive, diversionary and divisive public policy that is not consistent with widely held values. it not only runs the risk of irrevocable error, it is also costly, to the public purse as well as in social and psychological terms. it has not been proven to have a special deterrent effect. it tends

human problems, rather than pursuing explanations that could inform positive strategies. it prolongs the suffering of murder victims families, and extends that suffering to the loved ones of the condemned prisoner. it diverts resources that could be better used to work against violent crime and assist those affected by it. the usa has carried out 1,193 executions since resuming judicial killing in 1977. florida accounts for 68 of these executions. there have been five executions in the usa this year. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: n

his third execution date in two years. he was convicted in 1998 of the murder of a young girl in 1997. his lawyer is appealing for clemency on the grounds that woods has learning disabilities. bobby woods was sentenced to death for the murder of 11-year-old sarah patterson, who was killed after being taken with her nine-year-old brother from the trailer where they lived with their mother, woodss former girlfriend. his death sentence was upheld on state and federal appeal. in june 2002, in atkins v. virginia, the us supreme court outlawed the death penalty for people who have mental retardation on the grounds that their reduced moral culpability and increased vulnerability rendered excessive a punishment supposedly reserved for the worst of the worst crimes and offenders. a new appeal was filed for bobby woods raising the claim that he had mental retardation. at a hearing in the state trial court, a clinical psychologist testified for the defence that, in his opinion, bobby woods qualified as mildly mentally retarded, with an iq of 68 and limitations in adaptive skill areas (see overleaf). he also pointed to an assessment done by another psychologist in 1997 placing woodss iq at 70. the state presented evidence to contest this, the court ruled against woods, and the texas court of criminal appeals (tcca) agreed. appeals to the federal courts were unsuccessful. bobby woods's clemency petition to the texas board of pardons and paroles appeals for greater flexibility than the courts have been able or willing to apply: while the law requires aspiring to a bright line rule  those who are or are not mentally retarded  mercy does not. if mr woods is not mentally retarded he is without question severely impaired in his intellectual and daily functioning, and atkins reasoning applies. the petition cites evidence of woodss mental impairment, as a child struggling to keep up even in special education, and as an adult. it also raises the question of bobby woods's legal representation during the appeals process, and in the initial legal challenges under the atkins v. virginia ruling. the lawyer in question visited bobby woods only once in the 10 years he represented him, and filed an ill-prepared petition for the state appeal process. for the legal challenge under the atkins ruling, he presented only one witness, the clinical psychologist, but failed adequately to support him or present other witnesses or evidence to challenge the state. this lawyer became one of only two lawyers to have been removed from the tccas list of attorneys deemed qualified to represent death row prisoners in their state appeals. after taking on bobby woodss case, his current lawyer found further evidence to support the mental retardation claim, including an iq score of 60 from his childhood. however, because there had already been a review of the atkins claim, a stricter standard applied to any further review. the courts rejected the appeal. background information in its atkins v virginia ruling, outlawing the execution of people with mental retardation, the us supreme court did not define mental retardation, although it pointed to definitions used by professional bodies. under such definitions, mental retardation is a disability, manifested before the age of 18, characterized by significantly sub-average intellectual functioning (generally indicated by an iq of less than 70) accompanied by limitations in two or more adaptive skill areas such as communication, self-care, work, and functioning in the community. the court left it to individual states to develop appropriate ways to comply with the ruling. before the atkins decision, texas accounted for nine of 44 of the usas executions since 1977 of people documented as having mental retardation, more than any other state. more than seven years after the atkins ruling, the texas legislature has still not enacted a law to comply with the ruling. in the absence of legislation, in 2004 the tcca took it upon itself to issue guidelines for texas trial courts in making retardation determinations. in 2007, the tcca emphasized that its 2004 guidelines were intended only to be temporary pending action by the state legislature. nearly three years later, the legislature has still not acted on this. meanwhile, the tcca guidelines, according to a recent study, present an array of divergencies from the clinical definitions in applying atkins. amnesty international opposes unconditionally the execution of bobby woods, as it does every execution, regardless of the seriousness of the crime or the culpability of the condemned. to end the death penalty is to abandon a destructive, diversionary and divisive public policy that is not consistent with widely held values. it not only runs the risk of irrevocable error, it is also costly, to the public purse as well as in social and psychological terms. it has not been proven to have a special deterrent effect.

prisoner. it diverts resources that could be better used to work against violent crime and assist those affected by it. in addition to seeking commutation, bobby woodss lawyer has asked the parole board to grant a 60-day reprieve so that she can make a videotape to present to them. she has told the board that to fully understand the extent and nature of mr woods disabilities, it is necessary to meet him, or at a minimum, observe him interacting with other people. she was denied access by the prison authorities for this purpose (some interview footage of bobby woods is available at",0,"bobby

beatings with hoses and electrical cords, denial of food, clothing and basic necessities, and suffering on a scale difficult to imagine. mental health experts have linked this abuse with john muhammads brain dysfunction. background information state and federal officials were divided over where to first prosecute john muhammad and lee malvo, and which jurisdiction would be best placed to obtain and carry out the death penalty became a disturbing part of the decision-making process. despite the fact that the two suspects were arrested in maryland and most of the murders had happened there, the prosecutions were handed to virginia which, unlike maryland and the federal government, was and remains one of the most efficient executing jurisdictions in the usa, second only to texas in the number of executions carried out since 1977 and with a reputation for moving cases swiftly through the appeals system. on 7 november 2002, us attorney general john ashcroft, an ardent advocate of capital punishment, announced that virginia should conduct the initial prosecutions, emphasizing at a press conference that it was imperative that the ultimate sanction be available for those who have committed these crimes, even in the case of the teenaged malvo. the 2002 sniper shootings were undoubtedly traumatic for the individuals and communities affected by them. amnesty international does not seek to downplay the seriousness of these crimes or the suffering they have caused. it nevertheless opposes unconditionally the execution of john allen muhammad, as it does every execution, regardless of the seriousness of the crime or the culpability of the condemned. to end the death penalty is to abandon a destructive, diversionary and divisive public policy that is not consistent with widely held values. it not only runs the risk of irrevocable error, it is also costly, to the public purse as well as in social and psychological terms. it has not been proven to have a special deterrent effect. it tends to be applied in a discriminatory way, on grounds of race and class. it denies the possibility of reconciliation and rehabilitation. it promotes simplistic responses to complex human problems, rather than pursuing explanations that could inform positive strategies. it prolongs the suffering of murder victims families, and extends that suffering to the loved ones of the condemned prisoner. it diverts resources that could be better used to work against violent crime and assist those affected by it. today, some 139 countries are abolitionist in law or practice. international law is abolitionist in outlook, seeking to have retentionist countries narrow the applicability of the death penalty with a view to ending its use altogether. consistent with this, even those tried by international tribunals for the most serious crimes of concern to the international community - crimes against humanity, genocide and war crimes - cannot be subjected to the death penalty. in july 2002, a year before john muhammad was sentenced to death, the rome statute of the international criminal court came into force. under article 77 of the statute, the maximum penalty which the court can impose is life imprisonment, subject to review after 25 years. lee malvo was also tried in virginia, and was sentenced in december 2003 to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, a sentence which violates international law in the case of an offender convicted for a crime committed when he or she was under 18 years old (see ua 288/03, 9 october 2003, and update, 24 december 2003). there have been 42 executions in the usa this year, bringing to 1,178 the total number of executions carried out there since judicial killing resumed in 1977. virginia accounts for 103 of these executions. see also, usa: the execution of mentally ill offenders, january 2006,",0,"john muhammad"

any testimony about the effect of the use of the bible on the jury. the jurors recalled there having been several bibles present, that highlighted passages had been passed around, that a juror had read aloud from the bible to a group of fellow jurors, and that the text included the passage, and if he smite him with an instrument of iron, so that he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death. the judge ruled that the jury had not acted improperly and this was upheld by the texas court of criminal appeals. in 2002, a danish journalist interviewed a fifth juror. the latter said that about 80 per cent of the jurors had brought scripture into the deliberation, and that the jurors had consulted the bible long before we ever reached a verdict. he told the journalist that he believed the bible is truth from page 1 to the last page, and that if civil law and biblical law were in conflict, the latter should prevail. he said that if he had been told he could not consult the bible, i would have left the courtroom. he described himself as a death penalty supporter and life imprisonment as a burden on the taxpayer. in 2008, the us court of appeals for the fifth circuit found that the jurors had crossed an important line by consulting specific passages in the bible that described the very facts at issue in the case. this amounted to an external influence on the jury prohibited under the us constitution, and was a more egregious case than had occurred in other circuits, according to the fifth circuit. however, it concluded that under the highly deferential standard by which federal courts should review state court decisions, oliver had failed to prove that he had been prejudiced by this unconstitutional juror conduct. in april 2009, the us supreme court refused to take the case. background information under international and us law, a criminal defendant has the right to be tried before an impartial court. the principle of impartiality demands that each of the decision-makers, whether judge or juror, be unbiased. actual impartiality and the appearance of impartiality are both fundamental for maintaining respect for the administration of justice. this is not the only time that us federal courts have considered a case in which jurors consulted the bible during deliberations. the decisions emanating from these cases in the various federal circuits have been inconsistent, including on how to evaluate potential prejudice to the defendant. in a brief in 2009, 46 former federal and state prosecutors urged the us supreme court to take the oliver case to resolve such issues. the brief argued: a jury that consults the bible during sentencing deliberations is exposed to an outside influence in violation of the sixth amendments guarantee of a fair trial by an impartial jury even under ordinary circumstances, deprivation of a constitutional right is of the utmost concern. such concern is all greater here, where the constitutional violation occurs in the context of jurors decision to impose the ultimate punishment. guidance of the supreme court was urgently needed, the former prosecutors argued, not least because the lack of consensus among the us courts of appeals regarding juror consultation of the bible in the capital context not only generates inconsistent outcomes, but creates the appearance of arbitrariness in an area that demands consistency and fairness. the supreme court declined to take the case. an issue on appeal has also been the states use of testimony from two accomplices in the burglary  the 15-year-old who was shot in the leg and his 16-year-old brother who had waited outside  who were promised 10- and five-year prison sentences respectively in return for their testimony. in 2002, the brothers signed affidavits stating that they had been coached by the prosecutor in how to make their testimony match each others. khristian olivers trial lawyer then also signed an affidavit in which he stated that at the time of the trial he had been unaware of the prosecutors role in promoting the presentation of consistent stories by the brothers. if he had been, he said, he would have sought a mistrial, and at least to have brought the matter to the attention of the jury to raise questions about the reliability of testimony upon which the state was seeking to rely. race has been another issue, a sensitive topic in rural east texas (see, for example, usa: death in black and white, 9 august 2001,",0,"khristian oliver"

taken to be executed on 15 september, but the team administering the lethal injection failed to find a useable vein, and gave up after two hours. the state of ohio rescheduled his execution for 22 september.  on 18 september, a federal judge on the us district court for the southern district of ohio issued a temporary restraining order staying the execution of romell broom for 10 days.  this order currently expires at 11:59 pm on 28 september 2009. romell brooms execution was set for 15 september 2009 at 10am. the execution was delayed for several hours as a final appeal to the federal courts was awaited. between 1 and 2pm, after the courts had lifted the stay of execution, the lethal injection team began preparations for the execution. after an hour of the team trying to find a suitable vein in his arms, romell broom tried to help them. according to associated press, when his help made no difference, he turned onto his back and covered his face with both hands. his torso heaved up and down and his feet shook. he wiped his eyes and was handed a roll of toilet paper, which he used to wipe his brow. romell brooms lawyer was in the attorney waiting room. when she questioned the delay she was taken to a room where she could watch the procedure on closed-circuit television. she has said that it was perfectly apparent that the execution was going very wrong, and that romell broom was wincing in pain as the execution team held him down and tried to find a vein. at one point, she said, they really hurt him, and he grimaced in pain. she contacted her co-counsel to tell him what was happening  that the execution team had been trying for two hours to find a vein and had apparently now taken a break. the co-counsel sent a letter by fax and email to the state governor and the chief justice of the ohio supreme court, urging that the execution be stopped. his letter to the court pointed out that in the ongoing legal challenge to ohios lethal injection protocol, the states position had been that the medical members of the execution team are skilled at obtaining iv access. governor strickland, who had earlier denied bloom clemency, issued a one-week reprieve. the warrant reads, difficulties in administering the execution protocol necessitate a temporary reprieve to allow the department [of corrections] to recommend appropriate next steps to methe department should carry out mr brooms sentence [on 22 september] unless further reprieve or clemency is granted. on 17 september, in relation to the ohio lethal injection lawsuit, a federal judge ordered that by 21 september a statement be taken from romell broom about the execution attempt, and that the state disclose relevant documents by 28 september. background information on 3 may 1946, willie francis, an african american prisoner convicted of a murder committed when he was 17 years old, was taken to louisianas death chamber and placed in the electric chair, but due to some malfunction in the equipment, he survived and was returned to his cell. in january 1947, the us supreme court concluded that the prisoners constitutional rights had not been violated, dismissing the argument that because he had undergone the mental strain of preparing for execution, to require him to undergo it again would be to subject him to a lingering and cruel punishment. the court continued, even the fact that petitioner has already been subjected to a current of electricity does not make his subsequent execution any more cruel in the constitutional sense than any other execution. the cruelty against which the constitution protects a convicted man is cruelty inherent in the method of punishment, not the necessary suffering involved in any method employed to extinguish life humanely. the fact that an unforeseeable accident prevented the prompt consummation of the sentence cannot, it seems to us, add an element of cruelty to a subsequent execution. willie francis was returned to the electric chair on 9 may 1947 and killed. in the six decades since that chilling episode, the world has turned inexorably against the death penalty, recognizing its inherent flaws. today, 139 countries are abolitionist in law or practice. the usa, in contrast, has carried out 1,174 executions since resuming judicial killing in 1977, with 1,003 carried out by lethal injection, the method currently promoted by advocates of the death penalty as humane. in april 2007 the us supreme court upheld the constitutionality of kentuckys execution protocol. a majority of the usas death penalty states, and the federal government, use the same three-drug combination as kentucky to anaesthetise, paralyse and kill the condemned prisoner. in its baze v. rees ruling, the court recalled its 1947 decision in the francis case, noting that simply because an execution method may result in pain, either by accident or as an inescapable consequence of death, does not establish the sort of objectively intolerable risk of harm that qualifies as cruel and unusual. there have been regular botched lethal injections in the usa. in ohio in may 2006, for example, it took the execution team 22 minutes to find a useable vein in joseph clarks arm for insertion of the catheter. a few minutes later, however, the vein collapsed, and clarks arm began to swell. the team then tried for another 30 minutes to find another vein, while witnesses heard moaning, crying out and guttural noises coming from behind the curtain. death was pronounced about 90 minutes after the execution began. the following year, also in ohio, the execution team struggled to find useable veins in christopher newtons arms, and the prisoner was not declared dead until almost two hours after the execution process began. amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases, unconditionally, regardless of the method chosen to kill the condemned prisoner. the death penalty is inherently cruel and degrading, incompatible with human dignity. to end the death penalty is to abandon a destructive, diversionary and divisive public policy that is not consistent with widely held values. it not only runs the risk of irrevocable error, it is also costly, to the public purse as well as in social and psychological terms. it has not been proved to have a special deterrent effect. it tends to be applied in a discriminatory way, on grounds of race and class. it denies the possibility of reconciliation and rehabilitation. it prolongs the suffering of the murder victims family, and extends that suffering to the loved ones of the condemned prisoner. it diverts resources that could be better used to work against violent crime and assist those affected by it. there have been 38 executions in the usa this year, four of them in ohio. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: - pointing out the inherent cruelty of the death penalty, starkly illustrated in this

that they were unanimous that he permitted child abuse murder; or that they were divided as to the underlying theory. the jurors ticked the latter finding. one of the jurors has since said in an affidavit that most of the jurors considered that donald gilson had been the permitter rather than the committer, and that they had considered that permitting merely meant a failure to intervene rather than any active participation. according to donald gilsons current lawyer, a number of the jurors have expressed concern at the death sentence in light of the fact that bertha coffman received a life prison term: five have said that they consider his death sentence unfair; three that they would be relieved if his death sentence was commuted. in its ruling on donald gilsons case in april 2008, the us court of appeals for the 10th circuit noted that we have not found another first-degree murder statute similar to oklahomas. in an appeal to the us supreme court in november 2008, gilsons lawyers asserted that he is believed to be the only person in the united states on death row for an offense premised on permitting another to commit murder. research indicates that no one in the 232-year history of this nation has been executed on such an offense. in february 2009, the supreme court announced that it would not take the case. when the oklahoma court of criminal appeals upheld donald gilsons conviction and death sentence in 2000, one of the judges dissented. judge charles chapel wrote: the crime of permitting requires only that the defendant allows another to commit child abuse murder. no action is required  all that is necessary is that the defendant knows that child abuse is occurring but does not stop someone else from committing the crime. he argued that he could not uphold the death sentence because a defendant must have some personal culpability, beyond knowing about and failing to stop another from committing a crime, before the state may impose the ultimate punishment. judge chapel argued that the trial judge had erred in failing to instruct the jury that it could find donald gilson guilty of an offense less than first-degree murder. a three-judge panel of the 10 a three-judge panel of the 10th circuit upheld donald gilsons conviction and death sentence in april 2008. chief judge robert henry dissented, noting that evidence was presented at trial that mr. gilson played no part in abusing shane the day he died and that he was asleep on the couch during the abuse that led to shanes death. he also noted that bertha coffman had consistently claimed that gilson had not abused shane on the day of, or the few days before, his death. a rational jury, wrote the chief judge, could have believed this evidence and found mr. gilson guilty of culpable negligence, but not of actively permitting child abuse, as the oklahoma statute requires for a first-degree murder conviction. he argued that the jury should have been told that it could return a verdict of second-degree manslaughter. gilsons lawyers petitioned for a rehearing in front of the full 10th circuit court. this was denied by a vote of eight to four on the question of whether the punishment was proportionate, and by a vote of six to six on the jury instruction question. one more vote on the latter would have resulted in a rehearing and possible relief. on 14 april 2009, the oklahoma pardon and parole board voted three to two that governor henry should commute donald gilsons death sentence. among the witnesses against execution was the trial judge who said that the evidence did not justify the death penalty. according to media reports, he",0,"donald gilson"

due to be executed in virginia at 9pm local time on 19 february. he was sentenced to death in 2001 for the murder of a police officer in 1999. edward bell, who was convicted on largely circumstantial evidence, has consistently maintained his innocence of the murder. there are serious questions about the quality of his legal representation at trial, and his appeal lawyers argue that he may have mental retardation. on the evening of 29 october 1999, sergeant richard timbrook, a 32-year-old white officer, was working with two probation and parole officers in the city of winchester in north virginia. an incident arose in which sgt timbrook chased a man who had fled from the officers when they approached, and the sergeant was shot in the head as he was climbing a fence between two houses. the next morning, police found edward bell hiding in the basement of a house near the scene of the shooting. he told the police that he had fled when people he did not realize were law enforcement officers had got out of their car and started running towards him. he denied shooting sgt timbrook, saying instead that he had hidden when he heard the gunshot. the following day, a gun was found under the porch of the house where bell had been found. forensic testing established that this was the gun that had fired the bullet that killed the officer. dna recovered from the gun was a mixture from at least three people, and neither excluded nor identified bell. edward bells clemency petition presents governor timothy kaine with doubts about the reliability of bells conviction. an officer who caught sight of the person who shot sergeant timbrook saw a person who was dressed in black, but when edward bell was arrested he was wearing a jacket with reflective stripes on its sleeves that lit up like a christmas tree according to police who saw him running away from sgt timbrook. after bell was arrested, dozens of officers had conducted a meticulous day-long search for the murder weapon, but none was found. the crime scene was then left unsecured for several hours, after which police returned and, according to the clemency petition, were able to find the gun in a most obvious location lying near a bush several feet from where bell was found hiding. the clemency petition also draws attention to evidence that there was another person seeking to evade police in the area at the time of the shooting who was never investigated. the prosecutions final witness had been in jail with edward bell before the trial. this witness, terry johnson, testified (not under oath) that bell had confessed the murder to him and that he, johnson, had not been offered anything by the state in return for his testimony. he has since signed an affidavit under oath that when originally approached by the authorities, he had told them repeatedly that he had no information on the case. his affidavit states that the prosecutor promised a reduction in his own prison sentence, as well as relocation to a more favorable prison, and contact visits with his family and girlfriend. the failure of bells trial lawyers to investigate and present mitigating evidence at the sentencing phase of the trial left the jury ill-informed to make their life-or-death decision. the lawyer who was primarily responsible for developing the mitigation case had never handled a capital case before. a mitigation investigator with experience in over 200 cases who was hired to work on the case later described it as the most disorganized case she had ever attempted to work on. the trial lawyers consistently failed to respond to her efforts to carry out her work. the mitigation case presented at the trial consisted of two witnesses, the defendants sister and father, whose testimony amounted to less than seven pages of transcript. moreover, a federal district court judge noted that the defense lawyers did not ask bells sister or father a single question about bells background, his relationships with his family, his children, or any other potentially mitigating factors. indeed, the prosecutor emphasized in his closing argument that the defence had not produced one shred of evidence of mitigation. bells clemency lawyers have presented to governor kaine an array of character witnesses from whom the jurors never heard, and who would have provided a much more accurate and balanced understanding of bells life. one of the jurors later signed an affidavit in which she said: it was very important for me to hear about eddie bells background. i was undecided at sentencing and i wanted to hear something, anything about eddie bell we were looking from something mitigating, some reason not to sentence him to death, but we were given nothing by his lawyers and we felt his lawyers did him a disservice. after an evidentiary hearing, the us district court concluded in 2006 that bell had received deficient representation and that the virginia supreme courts ruling to the contrary was unreasonable. however, under the restrictive standards of us law on this issue, the judge upheld the state supreme courts conclusion that bell had not been prejudiced by his trial counsels performance. edward bells clemency petition also presents evidence that he may have mental retardation. if so, his execution would violate us constitutional law, under the 2002 us supreme court ruling atkins v. virginia. the virginia supreme court dismissed bells mental retardation claim as frivolous. his lawyers have since obtained further expert opinions that bells records indicate that he may have mental retardation. however, the courts have denied him a hearing on this issue. background information amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases, unconditionally.

21 november. he was sentenced to death in december 2004 for the murder of two children, aged six and seven, in 2002. he is not appealing his death sentence. this would be the first execution in kentucky for nearly a decade. according to the court record, on august 2002 marco chapman entered the home of carolyn marksberry in warsaw in northern kentucky to rob her. he raped and stabbed carolyn marksberry, but she survived. he also stabbed her three young children. two of them died. on arrest later the same day in neighboring west virginia, marco chapman asked one of the police officers to shoot him in the head. once charged, the trial judge conducted a competency hearing, at which a psychologist from the kentucky correctional psychiatric center (kcpc) testified that chapman had a history of mental health-related issues, including substance dependence, symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, and suicidal thoughts, and was suffering from chronic depression, but was competent to stand trial. after the judge agreed, the defendant wrote to the judge saying that he wanted to dismiss his lawyers, waive his right to a jury trial, and plead guilty to all the charges. he also stated that he was willingly ready to accept the sentence of death because that is the only acceptable sentence for the crimes i have [committed] against the [marksberrys] and humanity itself. the trial judge ordered another competency evaluation. the same kcpc psychologist testified that chapman was competent to make the decision to fire his attorneys and to ask to be executed, although his decision might change if he received mental health treatment. the judge ordered chapman to be treated and evaluated over the next month, and subsequently conducted another competency hearing. the kcpc psychologist testified that chapman had been prescribed anti-depressant medication, that depression could not be cured within a month, and that chapman still had depression. the psychologist reiterated his opinion that chapman was competent, and chapman himself testified that he still wanted to pursue his own execution. the judge ruled that chapmans eyes are wide open to the consequence of his choices and that he was competent to fire his legal counsel, plead guilty, and seek a death sentence. at the sentencing the following week, the judge passed a death sentence, having stated that he had not considered mitigation evidence presented to him by chapmans former lawyers, in the form of a psychological report, because the defendant did not want any mitigation evidence presentat the sentencing the following week, the judge passed a death sentence, having stated that he had not considered mitigation evidence presented to him by chapmans former lawyers, in the form of a psychological report, because the defendant did not want any mitigation evidence presented. upholding the death sentence in 2007, the kentucky supreme court stated that adhering to a defendants choice to seek the death penalty honors the last vestiges of personal dignity available to such a defendant. therefore, we hold that a competent criminal defendant is entitled to seek to plead guilty to a capital offense and, furthermore, to seek to receive the death penalty. the court rejected the notion that a defendant who pleads guilty in order to receive the death penalty is committing state- assisted suicide. background information since judicial killing resumed in the usa in 1977, about one in 10 of the more than 1,100 men and women put to death there had given up their appeals (see prisoner-assisted homicide  more volunteer executions loom, may 2007, http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/amr51/087/2007 ). any number of factors may contribute to a condemned inmates decision not to pursue appeals, including mental disorder, physical illness, remorse, bravado, religious belief, a quest for notoriety, the severity of conditions of confinement, including prolonged isolation and lack of physical contact visits, the bleak alternative of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, or pessimism about appeal prospects. in some cases it appears that the detainee may have committed the crime in order to receive a death sentence. pre-trial or post-conviction suicidal ideation seems to motivate the decision-making of some such inmates, including some whose abusive childhoods have left them traumatized or suffering mental health problems. with such cases in mind, the execution of volunteers is often compared to state-assisted suicide. however, prisoner-assisted homicide may be a more appropriate description of this phenomenon. given the rate of error found in capital cases on appeal, if the more than 130 volunteers executed since 1977 had pursued their appeals, there is a significant possibility that a number of them would have had their death sentences overturned to prison terms. to look at it another way, the phenomenon of volunteers contributes to the arbitrariness that is a part of the death penalty in the usa. amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases, unconditionally (see the pointless and needless extinction of life: usa should now look beyond lethal injection issue to wider death penalty questions, http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/amr51/031/2008/en ). today, some 137 countries are abolitionist in law or

kendrick at her apartment in dallas on the evening of 6 may 1999. he became upset on hearing a mans voice in the background, went to the apartment, and kicked the door open. when edith kendrick attempted to intervene between hudson and the man in the apartment, robert hudson threatened her with a knife. the other man ran out to call the police. edith kendricks eight-year-old son sustained serious cuts when he came between his mother and hudson, and fled. when edith kendrick attempted to flee, she was stabbed repeatedly. police arrived quickly and found robert hudson in a nearby shop. he subsequently signed a written statement admitting to stabbing edith kendrick. he was charged, and his trial began on 28 february 2000. the defense called no witnesses at either the guilt/innocence phase of the trial, or the subsequent sentencing phase, at which the jury sentenced him to death, on 1 march 2000. four of hudsons relatives have signed affidavits that they would have been willing to testify on his behalf at the trial, but that they had never been called by the defense. they have said that they could have testified not only to hudsons good character, but to his difficult family background and his childhood problems with anger management for which he was prescribed medication from an early age. the appeal courts have dismissed the claim that hudsons trial representation was inadequate. at the federal level, a district court dismissed his appeal in 2007. upholding the death sentence in april 2008, the us court of appeals for the fifth circuit concluded that on balance, we cannot say that a reasonable jurist would find debatable or wrong the district courts conclusion that hudson failed to show prejudice from counsels failure to investigate his four family members and to discover and present their mitigating evidence. up to and during his trial in 2000, hudson was prescribed anti-depressant medication. shortly before the trial began he was administered a number of different drugs, all of which can cause drowsiness, dizziness, confusion and fatigue. robert hudson has stated in an affidavit that he had trouble staying awake during the trial. in its 2008 ruling, however, the fifth circuit court of appeals rejected the argument that he had been forcibly medicated or that the administration of the drugs had adversely affected his competency to stand trial. the clemency petition filed on behalf of robert hudson states that in spite of his troubled background and the circumstances of his trial, mr hudson has never denied responsibility for the death of edith kendrick, nor claimed that his conduct was, in any way, excusable. to the contrary, he freely admitted his guilt prior to receiving any legal advice. however, the circumstances of his life should have been heard by a jury of his peers prior to their decision to terminate his life. that this did not occur was not his fault and casts doubt on the fairness of our judicial system. the clemency petition urges the board of pardons and paroles to recommend that the governor commute robert hudsons death sentence to life imprisonment. background information texas continues to account for a large number of the usas executions. of the 1,129 people put to death nationwide since 1977 when executions resumed in the usa, 418 were in texas. there have been 30 executions in the usa this year, 14 of them in texas. robert hudson is one of six inmates facing execution in texas before the end of november. since governor rick perry took office in 2001, 180 prisoners have been put to death in texas. virginia

gregory wright is scheduled to be executed in texas on 30 october. he was sentenced to death in december 1997 for a murder committed nine months earlier. donna vick was killed in her home in desoto, near dallas, in the early hours of 21 march 1997. later that day, john adams entered a video store in dallas and told the shop assistant to call the police because there had been a murder and he wanted to turn himself in. adams was arrested and gave a statement to the police that he and gregory wright had been at donna vicks house and that wright had stabbed her to death. gregory wright was tried first. adams did not testify, but the prosecution used the statement he had given to the police that wright was the actual murderer. the statement was a detailed account of the stabbing that was highly prejudicial to wright. wright was tried as the primary actor in the murder. the trial judge instructed the jury that it could convict wright only if it found that he had actually attacked donna vick. the court did not instruct the jury on the law of parties, the texas law under which the distinction between principal actor and accomplice in a crime is abolished and each defendant may be held equally culpable. wright was convicted and sentenced to death. john adams was tried some six months later under the law of parties. he too was sentenced to death, and he remains on death row without an execution date. on 21 june 2008, john adams signed a statement that i want the record clear that greg wright is innocent of the crime hes here on death row for. if you kill him your [sic] killing a innocent man. greg wright was used as a scape goat. im doing this because im tired of seeing innocent people being killed for murders theyve not done. the statement i made is a lie the one that i made at the first of our arrest. greg wright is innocent! i was there and know better. in follow-up statements signed on 6 august 2008, adams said that he had placed the murder on wright because i was trying to get it off my hands. he said that he, not wright, had killed donna vick, indicating that it was because of his newly found religious conviction that he was coming forward now. adams has not testified to the truth of his declarations in open court. another texas death row prisoner has signed a statement that adams has told me several times that he panicked and was scared [after the crime] and that [gregory wright] did not kill the lady. wrights clemency petition also raises other issues. one relates to statements made by daniel mcgaughey, the shop assistant who was told by adams to phone the police after the murder. a written statement that mcgaughey gave to police on 25 march 1997 stated that adams had approached him at the store and told him that there was a murder and he wanted to turn himself in, because he could not live with himself any longer. however, prior to giving this statement, mcgaughey apparently told an investigator that adams had said i murdered someone in desoto and i cant deal with it. i want to turn myself in. the inconsistency between the statements attributed to mcgaughey could render any tape recordings of his phone call to the police crucial. in a pre-trial hearing the prosecution informed wrights lawyers that there were no tapes, but after the trial began the defense learned that there was a tape of a call made by mcgaughey. questioned by the judge, the prosecutor said that a tape did exist at one point, but that he did not know where it was. the tape remains missing and has never been provided to wrights legal counsel. according to the clemency petition, wrights trial lawyers did not learn of mcgaugheys earlier statement until after wrights trial had started, when the prosecution provided them with documents pertaining to the case. wrights lawyers attempted to locate mcgaughey, but were unsuccessful and the prosecution claimed not to know his whereabouts. mcgaughey signed an affidavit in december 2001 that the authorities investigating the case knew where he was living in 1997. he further stated that in early 1998, after wrights trial, he received a number of visits from the prosecution authorities preparing for the trial of john adams. he was subpoenaed to testify at the trial, and spent two days at the courthouse, but he was never called by the state. wrights trial lawyers signed affidavits in 2002 that the prosecution failed to disclose to them the existence of a witness, jerry causey, who subsequently testified at adams trial that he had been in donna vicks car with john adams hours after the murder, and that adams had told him that he had killed vicks. in 2001, causey signed an affidavit restating this claim and adding that he had been contacted by the prosecution in approximately november of 1997, i.e. before wrights trial. the trial lawyers affidavits assert that if they had known about causey they would have called him at trial. the prosecution linked wright to the murder via articles found in a shack that wright was said to sometimes stay in. among the articles seized was a pair of jeans and a knife. dna testing established that the blood on them was donna vicks. the 2002 affidavits of wrights trial lawyers state that they had not learned until the third day of the trial that letters belonging to adams had also been found in the shack. each asserts that if he had known this he would have used the letters to impeach the states evidence that theshack and its contents were solely my clients property. at adams trial six months after wrights, the prosecution emphasized to the jury that the shack was shared by adams and wright. wrights current lawyers state that preliminary dna testing on the jeans found at the shack indicate adams dna on the inside thigh. in its closing argument at wrights trial, the prosecution emphasized to the jury that wrights bloody fingerprint is on the pillowcase that is right next to the head of the deceased. according to the clemency

scheduled to be executed in ohio on 14 october. he was sentenced to death on 5 december 1986 for two murders committed three months earlier. he was 19 years and two months old at the time of the crime. he has spent nearly 22 years on death row. in august 1986, 19-year-old richard cooey, who had had a serious drug and alcohol problem from around the age of 12, was home on leave from army training and went on a three-week alcohol and drug binge. on 31 august he had consumed marijuana, beer, cocaine and opium, and was with two friends, clint dickens, aged 17, and 18-year-old kenny horonetz. out in cooeys car that evening, the three teenagers stopped on a bridge over a freeway, at which point dickens dropped a piece of concrete over the parapet. the concrete hit a car with 21-year-old wendy offredo and dawn mccreery, aged 20, in it. the two young women were forced to stop, whereupon the teenagers offered them a lift. the five went to a nearby shopping mall, where wendy offredo telephoned her mother and dawn mccreery called the police. however, according to the court record, rather than being taken back to their damaged car by the teenagers, the two women were robbed and driven to a field where they were raped and murdered by cooey and dickens. richard cooey has said that he cooperated with the police after they promised that the death penalty would not be sought against him. nevertheless, cooey was brought to capital trial in november 1986 in front of a three-judge panel, after waiving his right to trial by jury. a few months earlier, the same panel of judges had passed a death sentence against a defendant represented by the same lawyer who had been appointed to represent cooey. it is not known if cooey had been advised of this by the lawyer or if he genuinely understood the full ramifications of waiving trial by jury. cooey was convicted of all charges after a two-day trial. the sentencing phase lasted one day, beginning and ending on 5 december, after which he was sentenced to death for murder, and to a total of 66 to 180 years imprisonment on the charges of kidnapping, rape, robbery and assault. clint dickens, a year and a half younger than cooey, was sentenced to life imprisonment. in line with international law, ohio prohibited the use of the death penalty against defendants who were under 18 at the time of the crime. the lawyer who represented cooey at trial was then appointed to represent him for his initial appeal. according to cooeys clemency petition, this lawyer failed to correspond with or visit him during this appeal period, or to provide him with copies of briefs filed in the appeal court. today, the courts would not appoint the same lawyer for trial and appeal, recognizing that any lawyer would be unlikely to raise a claimthe lawyer who represented cooey at trial was then appointed to represent him for his initial appeal. according to cooeys clemency petition, this lawyer failed to correspond with or visit him during this appeal period, or to provide him with copies of briefs filed in the appeal court. today, the courts would not appoint the same lawyer for trial and appeal, recognizing that any lawyer would be unlikely to raise a claim on appeal of his or her own ineffectiveness at trial. new lawyers appointed to cooeys case for subsequent appeals raised claims that the original lawyers representation at trial and on first-level appeal had been inadequate, but the ohio supreme court ruled that such claims had been waived because they had not been raised earlier and could only be reviewed under a plain error standard, a tougher standard than would have applied under normal review. in affirming his death sentence in 1989, the ohio supreme court noted that cooeys youth is entitled to some weight, but his military status makes it reasonable to expect more maturity from him than one might otherwise expect from a nineteen-year-old. his history as a severely abused child is certainly relevant for whatever it may have contributed to his mental problems. at the time of the crime, richard cooey was emerging from a childhood marked by abuse and neglect, including severe physical abuse at the hands of his father. as a boy, he began using alcohol at the age of five, and was abusing alcohol and drugs such as marijuana, speed and opiates on an almost daily basis from the age of 12. the state supreme court also noted that cooeys lack of a criminal record was entitled to some weight in mitigation. however, while acknowledging that cooey may have been less responsible for his acts than were most people, the court concluded that the mitigating factors were outweighed by the aggravating circumstances of the crime. according to the clemency petition, cooey has matured during his time on death row, come off drugs and alcohol, and accepted responsibility for what happened to wendy offredo and dawn mccreery (even though he has consistently maintained that he had a lesser role than clint dickens in the murders). his lawyers argue that he should be granted clemency not only because he is not the person he was 22 years ago, but because evolving standards support that outcome too. they note that death sentences are handed down less frequently in ohio today than they were two decades ago. this reflects a broader pattern of us capital jurors becoming more reluctant to pass death sentences, apparently as a result of the availability of life imprisonment without parole as an alternative, as well as greater public concern about the reliability and fairness of the capital justice system. for example, 300 death sentences were passed in the usa in 1986, compared to around 110 in 2007. in ohio, in 1986 there were 87 capital indictments, 15 of which (17 per cent) resulted in death sentences. in 2007, there were 67 capital indictments, four of which (6 per cent) resulted in death sentences. such statistics raise the question of whether richard cooey would be sentenced to death if tried today, given the mitigating factors in the case. in september 2007, the american bar association, which takes no position on the death penalty in september 2007, the american bar association, which takes no position on the death penalty per se, released its evaluation of ohios capital justice system. it called for a moratorium on executions in ohio after concluding that the state could not guarantee the fairness and accuracy of the capital justice system, or ensure that the ultimate penalty of death is reserved for only the very worst of offenses and defendants. among the problems it found were inadequate procedures to protect the innocent from the death penalty, inadequate access for capital defendants to experts and investigators, inadequate qualification standards for defense lawyers, inadequate appellate review of claims of error, lack of meaningful proportionality review of death sentences by the ohio supreme court, and racial and geographic disparities in capital sentencing. executions resumed in the usa in 1977, and 1,123 men and women have been put to death nationwide since then, 26 of them in ohio. there have been 24 executions in the usa this year. amnesty international opposes the death penalty unconditionally. today, 137 countries are abolitionist in law or practice. recommended action: please send appeals to

executed in georgia at 7pm on 16 september. he was sentenced to death in june 1975 for the murder of his wife, barbara jean alderman, which had taken place nine months earlier. he has been on death row for more than 30 years. he was 22 years old at the time of the crime, and has already effectively served a life sentence. he has consistently maintained his innocence of the murder. in 1983 alderman was granted a new sentencing, and he was resentenced to death in 1984. his co-defendant, john arthur brown, whom jack alderman was alleged to have recruited to commit the murder in return for a share of a life insurance payout, was also sentenced to death in 1975, a few months after aldermans trial. his sentence was overturned and he was sentenced to life imprisonment in late 1978. brown was released in about 1990, and died in 2000. the us court of appeals for the 11th circuit stated in 2006 that the states case hinged principally on browns testimony. brown had testified at aldermans 1975 trial while awaiting his own trial for the murder, and later testified at aldermans 1984 resentencing. not all murders are punishable by the death penalty in the usa. the prosecution sought a death sentence for jack alderman at his resentencing on the basis of two aggravating circumstances: that he murdered his wife to obtain insurance money, and that the murder was carried out in an outrageously vile or inhuman way. the prosecutor used john browns testimony to bolster the states theory on the first of these, with brown stating that alderman had asked him to participate in the murder and had promised him half of the insurance money. in fact, it seems that the life insurance policy she had with her employer had lapsed at the time of her death. the 11th circuits 2006 ruling on the case noted that the states insurance motivation for the murder therefore depended solely on the testimony of john brown. john brown provided the only evidence going to the second aggravating circumstance, i.e. how the murder was allegedly carried out. brown stated that he, brown, had hit barbara alderman on the head with a wrench. when this did not kill her, brown said that the two men held her head under water in the bath. brown admitted at the resentencing to consuming large amounts of alcohol and using drugs, including up to an ounce of marijuana a day, and taking large amounts of barbiturates and using speed, lsd, opium and quaaludes. the jury heard evidence that brown was intoxicated at the time of the murder, and that he experienced blackouts, hallucinations and memory loss as a result of his lsd use. according to later affidavits from browns former wife and his daughters, his drug use began after he returned from serving in the vietnam war, after which he had become violent and mentally and physically abusive. the jury heard evidence from a man who had been in jail with brown in december 1974. he testified that brown had told him three different versions of the murder, one of which had him alone killing barbara alderman. according to the 11th circuits ruling on the case, aldermans trial lawyers also obtained taped testimony from another man who had shared a cell block with brown after browns conviction in 1975 and who apparently described how brown had told him that he had committed the murder alone. however, the tape and the witness went missing before the resentencing, and the witness was only located after alderman had been resentenced. at the resentencing, aldermans lawyers presented the testimony of 11 prison guards, each of whom stated that alderman was an exemplary prisoner. since being resentenced to death his reputation as a model prisoner has continued. a priest who has known alderman for most of his time on death row and has called for clemency has written that alderman has cared for others in prison who are retarded and mentally ill and has mentored many a young man into finding peace in the most difficult and trying circumstances. jack aldermans role as a peacemaker is well-known to all: prisoners and prison staff alike. the georgia board of pardons and paroles has refused to reconsider jack aldermans case. it denied him clemency in october 2007, but his execution was stayed pending the us supreme court's consideration of the constitutionality of lethal injection. after the supreme court's ruling, jack aldermans lawyers asked the board to hold a clemency hearing. the board refused. since then, aldermans legal team has located several jurors from both the 1984 resentencing and the 1975 trial. four have signed sworn affidavits supporting clemency. a woman who served on the 1984 jury has stated: i remember the testimony of john brown being very important. his description of how the crime occurred was important in my decision to vote for death. at the time of trial, he testified that he received no deal for testifying against jack alderman. i have since learned that john brown was promised a benefit for his testimony. i have also learned that his sentence was commuted and that john brown spent only 12 years in prison. i believe this is unfair and that both mr brown and mr alderman should have received the same punishment, especially because john brown was at least as guilty as jack alderman. now that i know john brown received a lesser sentence, and that jack alderman has been a model inmate for the past 34 years, i do not believe he should be executed. i now support clemency a man who served on the 1975 jury states: i believe it is unfair that jack alderman be executed when mr brown got such a comparably light sentence despite admitting to killing barbara aldermani have also leaned that mr alderman has been denied clemency without a hearing on the matters of his good deeds and peacefulness while in prison. again i believe it is unfair for mr alderman not to receive consideration on this, particularly when john brown received parole years ago. another man who was an alternate juror at the 1984 re-sentencing has stated that it does not make sense to execute jack alderman after over 30 years in prison and when he is clearly not a danger to society jack alderman should not be executed. another juror from the 1984 proceedings stated: it seems unfair to me that john brown was released while jack alderman faces execution i think that because jack alderman has shown good character in prison all these years while at the same time john brown got paroled he does not deserve to be executed. when jack alderman was originally sent to death row in 1975, there had been no execution in the usa for about eight years and in georgia for 10 years. executions resumed in the usa in january 1977, and 1,118 men and women have been put to death around the country since then, 42 of them in georgia. there have been 19 executions in the usa this year, two of them in georgia. since the board of pardons and paroles denied jack alderman clemency in 2007, the un general assembly has voted for a moratorium on executions. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: - expressing sympathy for the family and friends of barbara alderman; - noting that the states case for the death penalty against jack alderman was based on the testimony of co-defendant john brown, and that there are serious doubts about the reliability of his evidence; - noting that several jurors from the 1975 trial or the 1984 resentencing support clemency, for reasons including what they see as the unfairness of the disparity between jack aldermans and john browns sentences and because of jack aldermans model conduct in prison; - noting that jack alderman has effectively served a life sentence, having spent over 30 years on death row; - expressing

like i was the one who killed the officer  they made it clear that we werent leaving until i told them what they wanted to hear. they suggested answers and i would give them what they wanted. they put typed papers in my face and told me to sign them. i did sign them without reading them. in his 2002 affidavit he said that he couldnt honestly remember what anyone looked like or what different people were wearing. antoine williams, a burger king employee, had just driven into the restaurants car park at the time the shooting occurred. at the trial, he identified troy davis as the person who had shot officer macphail. in 2002 he stated that this was false, and that he had signed a statement for the police which he could not and did not read: even today, i know that i could not honestly identify with any certainty who shot the officer that night. i couldnt then either. after the officers talked to me, they gave me a statement and told me to sign it. i signed it. i did not read it because i cannot read. at troy daviss trial, i identified him as the person who shot the officer. even when i said that, i was totally unsure whether he was the person who shot the officer. i felt pressured to point at him because he was the one who was sitting in the courtroom. i have no idea what the person who shot the officer looks like. on 17 july 2007, the state board of pardons and paroles stayed daviss execution less than 24 hours before it was to be carried out. the georgia supreme court then considered whether a trial-level judge had been wrong to dismiss daviss appeal for a new trial in 2007 without conducting a hearing. on 17 march 2008, in a 4-3 ruling, the state supreme court ruled that the lower court had not abused its discretion. the chief justice authored the dissenting opinion. she wrote that this case illustrates that this courts approach in extraordinary motions for new trials based on new evidence is overly rigid and fails to allow an adequate inquiry into the fundamental question, which is whether or not an innocent person might have been convicted or even, as in this case, might be put to death. in this case, she wrote, nearly every witness who identified davis as the shooter at trial has now disclaimed his or her ability to do so reliably. three persons have stated that sylvester coles confessed to being the shooter. two witnesses have stated that sylvester coles, contrary to his trial testimony, possessed a handgun immediately after the murder. another witness has provided a description of the crimes that might indicate that sylvester coles was the shooter. while she said that such testimony might be discovered to lack credibility if heard at an evidentiary hearing, the collective effect of all of daviss new testimony, if it were to be found credible by the trial court in a hearing, would show the probability that a new jury would find reasonable doubt of daviss guilt or a least sufficient residual doubt to decline to impose the death penalty. the dissenters argued that the trial court should be ordered to conduct the evidentiary hearing it denied in 2007. amnesty international opposes troy daviss death sentence unconditionally, as it does all use of the death penalty. for a full report on this case, see usa: where is the justice for me? the case of troy davis, facing execution in georgia, february 2007,",0,"troy davis"

convict him on charges of less than first-degree murder, although the state court of criminal appeals characterized the crime as one in which things went amiss when [youngs] intended robbery victim

the usa is supposed to be reserved for the worst crimes and worst offenders. only a small percentage of murders result in a death sentence, and an even smaller percentage in execution. as the us supreme court has said, the culpability of the average murderer is insufficient to justify the most extreme sanction available to the state. selecting who shall live and who shall die for their crimes is something of a lottery, with issues of race, prosecutorial discretion and conduct, and the quality of legal representation among the factors that determine who receives a death sentence and who does not. in kevin youngs case, the defense lawyer attempted to argue to the jury that the death penalty was reserved for the worst of the worst murderers, and that kevin young was not such a defendant. the prosecutor responded with the argument that there is nothing worse than first-degree murder, and if this was an inappropriate case for the death penalty, we wouldnt be here. she urged the jurors to pass a death sentence, arguing that young did not deserve to live in a prison environment, not have to go to work every day, get his meals prepared, have a nice clean place to live while the victim lies dead in his grave. as amnesty international found in a report on oklahomas death penalty in 2001, encouraging jurors to vote for execution out of a sense of vengeance appeared to be a favored tactic of oklahoma county prosecutors. the state court of criminal appeals has repeatedly condemned such inflammatory misconduct, but has routinely failed to provide any remedy. in kevin youngs case the appeal court once again issued its condemnation, saying that the prosecutor clearly should have known better, but upheld the death sentence. on appeal, it has been argued unsuccessfully that young received inadequate representation at trial, from a lawyer who failed to present evidence of the impact on the mental, emotional, and moral development of children raised in the inner city ghetto of south-central los angeles in california, where kevin young grew up, the youngest of 16 children in his family. the oklahoma court of criminal appeals found that trial counsel could well have utilized this evidence and it may have been prudent for him to do so, but that the lawyer had not been ineffective for having failed to present such mitigation evidence. it noted at the same time that there was evidence that several jurors felt there was little information about [youngs] past and they did not perceive remorse on [his] part, a perception emphasized by the prosecutor in seeking a death sentence. studies show that perceived lack of remorse is a highly aggravating factor in the minds of us capital jurors. under us law, citizens are excluded from capital jury service if they are opposed to the death penalty, rendering capital juries non-representative of the community (and more conviction-prone, studies show). in kevin youngs case, three potential jurors were removed during jury selection by the prosecution because they were opposed to capital punishment on religious grounds (another two were excluded because they were opposed for other personal or philosophical reasons). while religious beliefs caused the removal of jurors, it has been alleged that religion also played a part in the sentencing deliberations of the jury. at a post-trial hearing, one of the jurors testified that a bible had been consulted in the jury room. this juror had previously told a defense investigator that she herself had originally wanted a life sentence but that verses read from the new testament book of romans during deliberations had swayed her into voting for a death sentence (the text in question included if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of god, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evilrender therefore to all their dues.). after the hearing, the judge found that although a new testament bible might have been present in one of the jurors briefcases during the sentencing phase, there was no credible evidence that the bible had been brought into the jury room or used during the deliberations. the court of criminal appeals upheld the death sentence, saying that although the jurors may have discussed the bible in general or even specific bible verses, four of the five jurors testified no one read from a bible during sentencing deliberations. there have been 1,108 executions in the usa since judicial killing resumed there in 1977, 87 of them

executed in south carolina on 6 june. he was sentenced to death in 2000 for the murder of three social workers in an office shooting in 1996. david hill has given up his appeals. josie curry, michael gregory and james riddle were shot dead by david hill in the office of the department of social services (dss) in north augusta, south carolina, on 16 september 1996. the next morning police found david hill lying on railway tracks not far from the dss building. he had shot himself in the head, but survived, with critical injuries. david hill was brought to trial in 2000. a doctor testified that although hill had sustained frontal lobe damage to his brain when he shot himself, and was suffering from a degree of memory loss, he could understand the charges against him and would be able to follow the proceedings if he paid attention. several experts testified that david hill was suffering from serious mental health problems at the time of the crime, and was apparently not taking his medication on the day of the shootings. a psychiatrist who had been treating him in the months before the crime testified that hill was suffering from three major mental disorders: post-traumatic stress disorder, panic disorder and major depressive disorder. he stated that a number of traumatic events in hills life had contributed to this, including his near-drowning when he was a teenager, his guilt over causing a car accident when he was 18 which killed his sister, witnessing an explosion at his workplace, and the stress of his daughter being left paraplegic in a car accident in 1995 (she died in 1998). david hill made a number of suicide attempts in the months before the crime. in july 1996, police had been called to his home when he was threatening to kill himself with a shotgun. he was eventually talked out of it by his psychiatrist and taken for treatment for depression. the shootings at the dss office took place about a week after his three-year-old daughter and his twin two-year-old sons had been taken into dss custody. the jury returned a death sentence and hill's automatic appeal was rejected by the south carolina supreme court in 2004. in may 2007, david hill wrote to the prosecuting authorities asking them to assist him to drop the rest of my appeals and have an execution date set. the following month, he changed his mind, but in july 2007 again decided to abandon his appeals. a hearing was held before a judge in august 2007 to establish whether hill was competent to make this decision. a psychiatrist testified that hill had suffered from severe depression and other mental disorders in the past, but that these were now in remission and he was not currently on medication for any mental illness. she testified that although he had

the past, but that these were now in remission and he was not currently on medication for any mental illness. she testified that although he had sustained brain damage and neurological impairments as a result of shooting himself in 1996, he had made a good recovery. the psychiatrist testified that david hills decision to drop his appeals appeared to be rational, that he knew the consequences of his decision and even believed that he could win an appeal if he proceeded to challenge his death sentence. hill had apparently decided to wait until his father, whose health was failing, would no longer be aware of his sons decision to waive his appeals. after the father was taken to hospital and placed on do not resuscitate status, david hill decided that he could now take the decision to expedite his own death. the psychiatrist also concluded that hills religious beliefs as a mormon had contributed to his decision. hill himself testified that part of my religious beliefs are that if you kill somebody, you shed somebody elses blood, that your blood has to be shed or you have to die in order to be forgiven for that, and thats one of my concerns and then there's some health issues that i'm dealing with that's bothersome at timestheres not really one big reason. there is just  several different factors. the judge found that hill was competent to waive his appeals, and this was upheld by the state supreme court on 28 april 2008. background information about one in 10 of the more than 1,100 men and women put to death in the usa since judicial killing resumed there in 1977 had given up their appeals (see prisoner-assisted homicide  more volunteer executions loom, may 2007, http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/amr51/087/2007 ). any number of factors may contribute to a condemned inmate's decision not to pursue appeals, including mental disorder, physical illness, remorse, bravado, religious belief, a quest for notoriety, the severity of conditions of confinement, including prolonged isolation and lack of physical contact visits, the bleak alternative of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, or pessimism about appeal prospects. in some cases it appears that the detainee may have committed the crime in order to receive a death sentence. pre-trial or post-conviction suicidal ideation seems to motivate the decision-making of some such inmates, including some whose abusive childhoods have left them traumatized or suffering mental health problems. with such cases in mind, the execution of volunteers is often compared to state-assisted suicide. however, prisoner-assisted homicide may be a more appropriate description of this phenomenon. rational or irrational, an inmates decision to waive appeals may simply stem from a desire to gain a semblance of control over a situation in which they are otherwise powerless. as the us supreme court recognized over a century ago, when a prisoner sentenced by a court to death is confined in the penitentiary awaiting the execution of the sentence, one of the most horrible feelings to which he can be subjected during that time is the uncertainty during rational or irrational, an inmates decision to waive appeals may simply stem from a desire to gain a semblance of control over a situation in which they are otherwise powerless. as the us supreme court recognized over a century ago, when a prisoner sentenced by a court to death is confined in the penitentiary awaiting the execution of the sentence, one of the most horrible feelings to which he can be subjected during that time is the uncertainty during the whole of itas to the precise time when his execution shall take place. one way for a prisoner to end this cruel uncertainty is to ask to be killed by the state. given the rate of error found in capital cases on appeal, if the more than 120 volunteers executed since 1977 had pursued their appeals, there is a significant possibility that a number of them would have had their death sentences overturned to prison terms. to look at it another way, the phenomenon of volunteers contributes to the arbitrariness that is a part of the death penalty in the usa. there have been 1,102 executions in the usa since judicial killing resumed there in 1977, 37 of them in south carolina. today, 137 countries are abolitionist in law or practice. in late 2007, the un general assembly passed a landmark resolution calling for a worldwide moratorium on executions. amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases, unconditionally (see the pointless and needless

osborne is scheduled to be executed in georgia at 7pm local time on 4 june. he was sentenced to death in august 1991 for two murders in august 1990. he has a clemency hearing at 9am on 30 may before the georgia board of pardons and paroles. he has been on death row for nearly 17 years. the bodies of linda seaborne and arthur jones were found in the front of a car in griffin, georgia, on 7 august 1990. both had been shot, apparently from the back seat of the vehicle. curtis osborne was arrested and subsequently told police that he had shot jones, to whom he owed money, because jones had threatened to beat him and was reaching for a weapon. on 14 august 1991, a jury convicted osborne on two counts of murder, finding that seabornes murder was committed in the course of joness murder, an aggravating circumstance that made the crime eligible for the death penalty. the trial moved into the sentencing phase at which a number of witnesses, including osborne's stepfather, sister, girlfriend, former employer and acquaintances testified to his good character and their experience of him as a hardworking and non-violent person. curtis osborne also testified on his own behalf: ""there were certain circumstances that took place that night [of the crime], and sometimes things happen out of emotion and not just deliberation. just things sometimes happen in certain ways. i want to say im sorry and i just ask you people to have mercy on me."" on 15 august 1991, the jury recommended that curtis osborne be sentenced to death. among the issues raised on appeal has been the claim that curtis osborne was denied effective legal representation at the sentencing phase because the trial lawyer failed to present expert mental health evidence in mitigation. osbornes federal appeal lawyer has presented evidence to the courts that curtis osborne suffered from major depressive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder, and that the trial lawyer could have hired mental health experts to present such evidence to the jury in arguing for a sentence of less than death. the courts have rejected the claim of inadequate assistance of counsel. at the 30 may clemency hearing, curtis osbornes lawyers will present the testimony of a psychiatrist, dr george woods, who has interviewed osborne and family members and reviewed relevant medical records. he says that ""none of this was done at the time of trial, except for a brief interview of mr osborne"". dr woods states that medical health testimony would have been important at trial to help to explain a crime that was ""so out of character with the previous person that mr osborne had been for many, many years."" dr woods found that osborne comes from a ""family of significant physical abuse, emotional abuse as well,"" and that his childhood was ""profoundly isolated and abusive."" he has also concluded that curtis osbornes family has a ""significant history of psychiatric disease"" going back at least three generations, and that osborne himself suffered from a major depressive disorder. from 1989, after losing his job, his mental health deteriorated and, according to dr woods, osborne began to self-medicate with cocaine. dr woods suggests that the combination of osbornes drug use and his mental health problems would have led to a magnification of the paranoia, of the hyper-vigilance, of the hyper-reactivity, and of the misperception of reality, and impaired his ability to conform his behavior to the law. such evidence, dr woods suggests, could have helped to explain to the jury the ""tremendous change"" in the defendant leading up to the crime. curtis osbornes federal appeal lawyer has also claimed that the trial lawyers failure to do an adequate investigation of his client by hiring expert witnesses was born of that white lawyers racial animosity towards his african-american client. the appeal lawyer obtained a sworn affidavit from a white man, gerald huey, who had been in jail with osborne before osbornes trial and who shared the same trial lawyer, johnny mostiler. the affidavit states: ""the first time i recall mr mostiler saying anything about curtis osbornes case was when he said, 'the little nigger deserves the death penalty.' i was shocked because i knew that mr osborne had not gone to trial yet that wasnt the only time mr mostiler said something like that though. i recall mr mostiler telling me that i wouldnt believe the amount of money he was going to spend on my case. he said he was going to hire a private investigator and get expert witnesses. he said the money he would spend on me was going to be a lot more than he would spend on mr osborne because 'that little nigger deserves the [electric] chair.' mr mostiler made similar comments to me both before and after mr osbornes trial."" another lawyer has recalled a case from around 1992 in which another african-american client of johnny mostiler, derek middlbrooks, stated in open court that mostiler had referred to him as one dumb nigger for not accepting the plea bargain offered by the state. questioned by the court, mostiler reportedly replied that he could not recall whether or not he had said this. curtis osbornes lawyer has recently obtained the transcript of proceedings in the middlbrooks case, in which the defendant seeks a new lawyer because of mostilers alleged use of this racial epithet. according to the transcript, middlbrooks says that mostiler ""indicated to me that he wouldnt, he couldnt go up there around those niggers because them niggers would kill me.""

on 17 june. he was sentenced to death in 1997 for the murder of ken yamamoto in january 1995. ken yamamoto, a japanese student, was living in an apartment in oklahoma city that was located directly above the apartment where brenda gardner, her sister tammy gardner and the latters two young children lived. terry short was brenda gardners boyfriend until they broke up in late december 1994. in the early hours of 8 january 2005, a fire broke out in the gardners apartment. brenda and tammy gardner escaped with the children, but the fire spread to the apartment above where ken yamamoto was sleeping. he was taken to hospital with burns to 95 per cent of his body. he died a few hours later. terry short was charged with throwing a firebomb through the patio door of the gardners apartment, causing the fire that killed ken yamamoto. he was also charged with five counts of attempted murder  of the two gardner sisters, the children and robert hines, who was visiting their apartment at the time. at the trial, the state presented eyewitness testimony from brenda gardner and robert hines. gardner testified that she had seen terry short outside the apartment just before the fire, although she had not seen him throw the alleged firebomb. hines said that he had seen short outside the apartment, but admitted that he had only assumed it was short because the gardners had said that he had been outside the apartment earlier. the state presented an expert who said that a molotov cocktail had been thrown into the apartment. another expert testified for the defense that in her opinion the fire scene was not consistent with a firebomb having started the fire. the state also presented the testimony of jay brown, a jailhouse informant, who said that terry short had admitted to him in jail that he had started the fire after finding hines and brenda gardner having sex, and that short had scrawled derogatory comments about gardner on the wall of the jail cell. browns testimony was given in return for leniency on charges he was facing. the defense lawyers sought to present the testimony of another inmate, mark bayless, who had also shared the jail cell, and who they said would refute every single word that jay brown testified to. however, the trial judge refused to allow bayless to testify because the defense had revealed too late to the prosecution their intention to present him. in its ruling on the case in 2006, the us court of appeals for the 10in its ruling on the case in 2006, the us court of appeals for the 10th circuit said that browns testimony was relevant to the prosecution because it served as the only testimony from an unrelated party directly connecting mr short to the crime. it found that the testimony of mark bayless, if true and credible, would have been similarly relevant and could have served to impeach browns credibility. it further stated that the exclusion of relevant, probative, and otherwise admissible evidence is an extreme sanction that should be used only when justified by some overriding policy consideration. the 10th circuit noted that there was no evidence that the defense had acted in bad faith in failing to disclose their intention to present bayless. indeed, the defense had suggested to the trial judge that the remedy for their tardy disclosure would be to grant the prosecution time to interview bayless or to grant a recess in proceedings. in addition, the 10th circuit said that shorts interest in having the bayless testimony presented was significantly heightened by the fact that he was facing the death penalty. however, noting that the constitution entitles a criminal defendant to a fair trial, not a perfect one the 10th circuit court concluded that although the exclusion of the bayless testimony deprived the jury of relevant evidence, federal judicial review was required to be deferential to state court decisions, and it upheld the conviction. browns testimony was exploited at the sentencing by the prosecutor, who told the jury that in jail [short] bragged about how hed thrown a fire bomb. in addition, highly emotional victim impact testimony was presented by ken yamamotos mother at the sentencing. indeed, the state court of criminal appeals found in 1999 that this testimony had come very close to weighting the scales too far on the side of the prosecution by so intensely focusing on the emotional impact of the victims loss. one of the judges in that decision wrote a separate opinion referring to this especially troubling aspect of the case. however the court upheld the death sentence, as did the federal 10th circuit despite acknowledging that the mothers testimony was troubling, contained irrelevant information and that much of it was highly emotional. the oklahoma court of criminal appeals chastised the prosecutor for arguing that the jury should vote for execution rather than a prison sentence because it was not justice to allow the defendant three meals a day, a clean place to sleep, and visits by his friends while the victims mother daily grieves for her only son. the then oklahoma county district attorney, robert macy, who prosecuted terry short, was repeatedly condemned for such misconduct by the appeal courts (see old habits die",0,"terry short"

and (2) persuading the sentencing jury that sonniers moral culpability was not sufficient to warrant the death penalty. however, a successful appeal on a claim of inadequate legal representation is difficult to achieve under us constitutional law. the prisoner must prove that not only was the trial counsels performance sub-standard, but that this had altered the outcome of the trial. in derrick sonniers case, the fifth circuit concluded that he had failed to prove this second aspect. although the fifth circuit said that the mitigation evidence would have shown positive aspects of his character, it concluded that it still would not have outweighed the aggravating facts of the crime, and the trial outcome would have been the same. ultimately, a post-conviction assessment  however carefully made  of how a jury would have voted if it had been presented with particular evidence effectively amounts to judicial guesswork, clearly troubling when a life is at stake. moreover, when defendants refuse to allow their defense counsel to present available mitigating evidence, for whatever reason, it feeds into the arbitrariness of the death penalty. the mandatory death penalty has long been ruled unconstitutional in the usa, and the capital sentencing decision is supposed to be individualized, with the jury being able to take into account any mitigating evidence and the prosecution presenting the reasons why the defendant should be executed rather than imprisoned. as a us supreme court justice said in 1979, this courts toleration of the death penalty has depended on its assumption that the penalty will be imposed only after a painstaking review of aggravating and mitigating factors. if the defendant refuses to allow any mitigating evidence, despite its availability, the system comes closer to tolerating a quasi-mandatory death sentence, with the jury not in a position to take into account the background and circumstances of the defendant to weigh against the facts of the crime and the governments bid for a death sentence. at the jury selection for sonniers 1993 trial, the judge refused to allow the defense to inform the jurors that sonnier would be ineligible for parole for 35 years if convicted and sentenced to imprisonment rather than death. in 1994, the us supreme court ruled that in cases where a state argues for execution based on the notion of a defendants future dangerousness  in texas, the jurys finding of future dangerousness is a prerequisite for a death sentence  the defendant must be allowed to respond by showing that if sentenced to life imprisonment, he or she would not be eligible for parole. however, at the time of sonniers trial, the choice facing the jury was only the death penalty or life imprisonment with the possibility of parole, albeit only after 35 years. sonniers case has been deemed not to fall within the scope of the 1994 precedent. there have been 1,101 executions since judicial killing resumed in 1977, 405 of them in texas. in late 2007, the un general assembly passed a landmark resolution calling for a worldwide moratorium on executions. amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases, unconditionally. there is no such thing as a humane, fair, reliable or useful death penalty system (see the pointless and needless extinction of life: usa should now look beyond lethal injection issue to wider death penalty questions,",0,"derrick sonnier"

the instructions given to the jury, and a resentencing was held in june 1992. at this hearing, the defense presented mitigating evidence, including testimony from a neuropsychologist about earl berrys low intellectual functioning and possible brain damage. a psychologist also testified that, in his opinion, berry suffered from paranoid schizophrenia. for his part, the prosecutor resorted to potentially inflammatory comments in seeking a death sentence. for example, he made what amounted to little more than a call for vengeance in a speech based around the notion of justice. he asked where is the justice and mitigation and mercy of being a faithful member of the first baptist church, a member of the choir, taught sunday school, there when the doors are open?this woman was there every time the doors were open, at night, sunday night. she missed choir practice that night. no doubt about that [t]here is only one verdict in my opinion. that is this man receive the death penalty, the same penalty mary bounds got without hearing by jury or a trial. that man acted as judge, jury, and executioner all in a matter of minutes. she didnt have any of the benefits of any justice or mitigation or mercy; and there is none due here in my humble opinion. the prosecutor also injected biblical references into the proceedings when urging the jury to vote for the death penalty, arguing for example, that its authorized by mississippi, and its been authorized by scriptural law for a long time. the jury voted for a death sentence. the sentence was again appealed to the state supreme court, which remanded the case to the trial court for a hearing on the prosecutors dismissal of five african american potential jurors during jury selection (the eventual jury had one african american on it). the defense argued that the african americans had been struck because the prosecution believed they would be less likely to vote for the death penalty. the prosecutor provided reasons for the dismissals. for example, he said that one african american had been dismissed because she had a patchy employment history, and another because he had relatives in jail and an unstable employment history. the trial court ruled that such reasons were race-neutral, and that a prima facie case of discrimination had not been made. earl berrys lawyers have challenged his death sentence with the claim that he has mental retardation. the us supreme court banned the execution of people with mental retardation in atkins v. virginia in 2002. in chase v. state in 2004, the mississippi supreme court announced the criteria for determining which inmates sentenced to death in mississippi before the atkins decision should receive an evidentiary hearing on a claim of mental retardation. under this test, the condemned prisoner must provide on appeal an affidavit from a qualified expert to the effect that the inmate has an iq of 75 or below, and in the opinion of the expert there is a reasonable basis to believe that, upon further testing, the defendant will be found to be mentally retarded. for reasons that are unclear, but possibly due to lack of funding for, and the sheer workload on, the understaffed public defender office representing earl berry at that time  berrys claim of retardation was not supplemented by the requisite expert affidavit after the chase ruling. in august 2004, the state supreme court ruled that berry had failed to comply with the chase criteria and denied him an evidentiary hearing. on 24 april 2008, a psychologist with expertise in mental retardation signed an affidavit stating that his review of the materials relating to earl berry had led him to the conclusion that berry had an iq of 75 or lower and/or significantly sub-average intellectual functioning, and to a reasonable degree of psychological certainty that further testing will demonstrate that mr. berry meets the criteria established by the american psychiatric association and the american association on mental retardation to be classified as mentally retarded. among other things, he noted that during berrys school years his iq was assessed as low as 72, and when the 25-year-old berry was discharged from a mississippi department of corrections prison hospital on 24 april 1985 following an apparent suicide attempt, the final diagnosis was suicidal gestures / mentally retarded. other affidavits  from earl berrys mother, other relatives, and people who knew berry  describe berrys slow development as a child, childhood head injuries he sustained as a boy, and the fact that even as an adult he never lived independently. his mother said that he attempted suicide six or seven times. on 5 may 2008, despite this new chase-compliant expert affidavit, the mississippi supreme court ruled that earl berrys claim of retardation was procedurally barred. the presiding justice of the court dissented: as an indigent defendant sentenced to the ultimate and final punishment, berry is entitled to appointed competent and conscientious counsel to assist him with his pursuit of post-conviction relief. he has now presented this court with substantial evidence that but for his post-conviction attorneys deficient performance, he would have been granted an opportunity to pursue his claim that he is mentally incompetent pursuant to atkins whatever the reasons for his prior counsels deficient performance, it is clear that berry was not allowed a meaningful opportunity to present his mental retardation claim to this court when appointed counsel fails to provide the court with the relevant facts, the system designed to ensure due process as well as a timely end to the appellate process, ceases to function. in the end, justice fails for all of those involved. since the usa resumed executions in 1977, 1,100 prisoners have been put to death, eight of them in mississippi. discrimination, arbitrariness and error have been hallmarks of us capital justice. amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases, unconditionally. there is no such thing as a humane, fair, reliable or useful death penalty system (see the pointless and needless extinction of life. usa should now look beyond lethal injection issue to wider death penalty questions,",0,"earl berry"

scheduled to be executed in georgia at 7pm on 6 may. he was sentenced to death in 1990 for the murder of his friend virginia (ginger) moore on 23 december 1988. he has a clemency hearing at 9am on 5 may before the georgia board of pardons and paroles. william lynd and virginia moore lived together at her home in georgia's berrien county. on the day of the murder, both were allegedly intoxicated on valium, marijuana and alcohol. they argued; lynd shot moore and buried her body in a shallow grave in a neighboring county. he went to ohio, but later returned to georgia and turned himself in to the berrien county authorities. virginia moores body was found using information he provided. william lynd was sentenced to life imprisonment for kidnapping and to death for murder. in his recent announcement that a week-long execution window had been set by the berrien county superior court (the department of corrections has since set the precise execution time), the georgia attorney general emphasized the prosecutions evidence at the 1990 trial that william lynd had shot virginia moore three times in the face and head. according to this evidence, after the couple had argued, lynd got his pistol and shot the victim in the face. the unconscious victim fell across the waterbed. lynd went outside, sat on the front porch, and smoked a cigarette. the victim eventually regained consciousness and staggered outside toward lynd. lynd turned and shot the victim a second time and the victim collapsed onto the porch. lynd then put moore into the trunk of her car and drove away from the house. when he heard her thumping around in the trunk, lynd opened it and shot the victim a third and final time. the attorney generals statement recalled that at the trial, forensic pathologist warren tillman testified that the victim died as a result of gunshot wounds to the head and face. dr tillman explained that the first shot fired into the victims face would not have been fatal. after the second gunshot wound, which was fired into the victim's brain, the victim would have been able to regain consciousness and could have moved her arms and legs. even after all three shots were fired, the victim may have been able to achieve consciousness for a period of time prior to her death. william lynds appeal lawyers have challenged the reliability of warren tillmans testimony and his qualification to provide it. they have also pointed to legislation passed shortly after lynds trial requiring that autopsies be performed by medical examiners who are licensed doctors, which they say warren tillman was not. dr brian frist, a medical doctor and pathologist who has since reviewed the materials relating to the shooting, concluded that contrary to mr tillmans testimony about these injuries, it is medically impossible that ms moore may have regained consciousness from either of [the wounds caused by the second two shots.] according to dr frist, the states version of the murder has no basis in medical science and mr tillmans testimony as to the possibility of a lingering death from either of these wounds is patently erroneous. in dr frist's opinion, the second gunshot wound immediately resulted in brain death and caused a cessation of all life processes most likely within a matter of seconds, but certainly no longer than within a minute and a half. the defense lawyers have also raised the conclusions of robert tressel, a former homicide detective with nearly 30 years of experience in crime scene analysis, who has reviewed the state's investigative files of the moore murder. he believes the totality of the evidence supports the scenario that mr lynd fired two shots in rapid succession causing wounds no. 2 and no. 3 to the left side of ms moore's head. these wounds were forensically consistent with mr lynds statement, i.e. he shot ms moore over his left shoulder after she attacked him from behind on the front porch, where he was apparently contemplating suicide after the first shot. like dr frist, robert tressel believes virginia moore was dead when she was put in the trunk of the car. if virginia moore was indeed dead at this point, not only would it call into question the charge of kidnapping, it would also diminish the aggravating circumstances of the crime that were presented to the jury as a part of the prosecutions pursuit of conviction for capital murder and which the state is still using to justify william lynd's execution. his lawyers are seeking judicial review of their claim that false evidence was presented at the trial in the form of the testimony of the states expert witness. however, his ordinary appeals have been exhausted. the appeal courts have rejected claims that lynds trial lawyers failed to conduct a reasonable investigation into his background, mental health and substance abuse problems. the last execution in the usa was on 25 september 2007. executions were put on hold pending the us supreme court's review of the constitutionality of lethal injection. on 16 april, in baze v. rees, the court upheld the constitutionality of kentucky's lethal injection procedures, and chief justice john roberts indicated that in future cases a stay of execution on the lethal injection issue would probably only be granted if the condemned prisoner establishes that the state's lethal injection protocol creates a demonstrated risk of severe pain. he must show that the risk is substantial when compared to the known and available alternatives. a state with a lethal injection protocol substantially similar to kentuckys would not create a risk that meets this standard. justice john paul stevens nevertheless suggested that litigation on the lethal injection issue would continue. william lynd's lawyers have filed such a challenge. since the usa resumed executions in 1977, 1,099 prisoners have been put to death. in the baze ruling, justice stevens, who has been on the supreme court since 1975, revealed that his experience had led him to the conclusion that the imposition of the death penalty represents the pointless and needless extinction of life with only marginal contributions to any discernible social or public purposes. a penalty with such negligible returns to the state is patently excessive and cruel and unusual punishment. in late 2007, the un general assembly passed a landmark resolution calling for a worldwide moratorium on executions. amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases, unconditionally, regardless of the method chosen to kill the condemned prisoner. there is no such thing as a humane, fair, reliable or useful death penalty system (see the pointless and needless extinction of life: usa should now look beyond lethal injection issue to

white, is scheduled to be executed in tennessee on 12 september. he was sentenced to death in 1999 for the murder of his three young sons and their half-sister in 1997. he has effectively waived his appeals, although he has characterized his approach as one of selective procedural default. on 30 november 1997, former soldier daryl holton walked into a police station in shelbyville, tennessee, to report a homicide times four. he said that he had shot his children in his uncles car repair garage. the police went to the garage and found the bodies of stephen edward holton (12), brent holton (10), eric holton (6) and kayla marie holton (4). at his trial, three mental health experts  two for the defense and one for the prosecution  all agreed that daryl holton had been suffering from a major depressive disorder when he killed the children. one of the defense experts, a psychiatrist, testified that filicide (the murder of ones own child) is closely associated with the occurrence of major depression, and in such cases the parent is on the sickest end of the spectrum. they have very severe major depression. it is often one with psychotic features [where] the individuals grasp of reality is severely lacking. the psychiatrist testified that holton had a family history of suicide, and had himself experienced previous episodes of major depression, dating back to high school and continuing through his military career. the prosecutions expert agreed that mr holton at the time of this crime suffered from major depression. he also agreed absolutely that severe depression can affect ones judgment and thought processes and cause delusions. however, he concluded that daryl holton could tell right from wrong at the time of the crime. after 50 minutes of deliberation, the jury rejected the defense of not guilty by reason of insanity and convicted holton on four counts of first-degree murder. against the advice of his lawyers, holton decided to largely forego the presentation of mitigating evidence at the sentencing phase, except testimony that he was a cooperative inmate in the jail who received visits from relatives. the jury voted that he should be executed. there has been a degree of dispute about whether daryl holton intended to waive the entirety of his appeals after the tennessee supreme court affirmed his convictions and death sentence in 2004. in any event, the effect has been that he has waived his appeals, and he has been found competent to do so. in april 2005, holtons lawyers filed an appeal in state court, signed by them but not by holton, adding that he had refused to meet with them. the lawyers raised concerns about holtons mental competency, claimed that he was quite possibly operating under suicidal motivations, and requested a competency hearing. the trial-level court ordered holton to meet with his lawyers and a court-appointed mental health expert, and allowed additional time for the filing of a completed post-conviction petition. the state appealed, and in may 2006 the tennessee supreme court found that the trial-level court had lacked the authority to consider the petition filed on behalf of daryl holton because he had not signed it and the lawyers had failed to establish a next friend basis on which to proceed. it also found that the petition had been filed too late. the state asked the tennessee supreme court to set a new execution date and holton himself filed a response stating that he does not oppose the states motion to reset an execution date. execution was set for 19 september 2006. meanwhile, holtons lawyers petitioned the federal courts, filing evidence that raised questions about his competence. in an affidavit, the psychiatrist who had testified at the trial suggested that holtons major depression had probably recurred and that any decision to volunteer for execution would fit the depressive pattern of thinking characteristic with [this illness]. an affidavit was also provided by a psychiatrist who had recently interviewed daryl holton and reviewed his records. he formed a preliminary opinion that holton was suffering from complex post traumatic stress disorder and depression, and concluded that there was reasonable cause to doubt that he was competent to waive his appeals. the state sought to dismiss the petition, and daryl holton stated that he had not authorized the petition and did not wish to proceed with it. the federal district court appointed a psychologist to evaluate holtons competence to waive his appeals. on 5 september 2006, this psychologist testified that, in his opinion, daryl holton was fully rational and especially informed of his legal options. the district court judge ruled that there was no reasonable cause to believe that the prisoner was incompetent and so there was no reason to have a full competency hearing. he dismissed the petition filed by the lawyers as unauthorized. the day before his execution, the us court of appeals for the sixth circuit issued a stay. it stated that this was an appropriate course of action, because an appeal written by daryl holton himself had just been filed in the us supreme court, seeking a stay of execution and raising a claim of ineffective trial and appellate counsel. in his petition, daryl holton said that he did not oppose the death penalty for crimes such as those of which he had been convicted, but that if his claims of his unconstitutional convictions were successful, it was his understanding that the resulting death sentences must also be set aside. the supreme court, without comment, refused to lift the sixth circuits stay of execution. in its order issuing the stay, the sixth circuit had instructed daryl holton to inform it personally whether he intended to pursue his appeal, and if so, whether he intended to do that himself or through his lawyers. holton responded in a handwritten letter to the court, dated 21 september 2006, that he could not at this time, in good faith pursue the appeal filed by his lawyers as it challenged his own competency to waive federal review of the claims they were raising. on 9 january 2007, the sixth circuit affirmed the district courts dismissal of the lawyer-filed petition. the state moved to have a new execution date set, and on 22 january, daryl holton wrote to the tennessee supreme court that his position had been one of consistent, calculated, deliberate, and selective procedural default rather than one of wholesale waiver [of appeals]. he ended by stating that he did not oppose the states motion to reset an execution date. the following week, the state supreme court set 28 february 2007 as the date on which holton would be killed. daryl holtons execution was again stayed after the governor imposed a moratorium in order that a review of execution procedures could be conducted. on 30 april, the governor announced that the review had been completed and that the moratorium on executions would expire on 2 may. on 4 may, the attorney general asked the tennessee supreme court to set a new execution date for daryl holton, and on 14 may his handwritten response was filed in the court stating that he does not oppose the states latest motion to reset an execution date. the state supreme court set 12 september 2007 as the date for the execution. amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases. there have been 1,095 executions in the usa since judicial killing resumed there in 1977, three of them in tennessee. more than 100 people have been executed after

that there was no agreement or plan to rob anyone; and that no one had encouraged brown to do what he did. he said that after the shot was heard, foster had appeared surprised and panicked and started to drive away, but dillard had told him to stop and wait for brown. julius steen signed an affidavit in 2003 clarifying his trial testimony, clarification that had not been elicited by the defense because their cross-examination was inevitably weak due to their lack of pre-trial contact with this witness. steen recalled that it was only when he had seen mauriceo brown standing opposite michael lahood that he understood what might be going down. at that point, and not before, i thought that brown might be robbing the man. he stated that there was no agreement that i am aware of for brown to commit a robbery at the lahood residence. i do not believe that foster and brown ever agreed to commit a robbery. in my opinion, i dont think that foster thought that brown was going to commit a robbery. when brown got back in the car, we were all shocked. even brown looked shocked. i dont think that brown knew why he shot the man and was surprised that he did. in a recent appeal, fosters lawyer has argued: foster clearly did not anticipate what brown himself did not foresee. brown clearly acted on his own independent impulse, and not pursuant to the imaginary robbery conspiracy that has trapped kenneth foster on death row. in 2005, a federal district judge found a fundamental constitutional defect in fosters sentence. in 1982, the us supreme court had ruled in enmund v. florida  in the case of a man who had been in a parked car while his accomplices committed robbery and murder in a house nearby  that the death penalty is disproportionate if it is imposed on a defendant who did not himself kill, attempt to kill, or intend to kill the victim. the court modified this rule five years later in tison v. arizona when it held that a defendant who participates in a crime that leads to murder and whose mental state is one of reckless indifference to the value of human life may be sentenced to death. the federal judge ruled that fosters jury had not been asked to determine if he had any intent to kill lahood, and that this failure represented a misapplication of the law. however, texas appealed to the fifth circuit court of appeals, which overturned the decision. since the usa resumed executions in 1977, 1,089 prisoners have been put to death; 398 of them in texas. there have been 32 executions in the usa in 2007, 19 of them in texas. the un safeguards guaranteeing protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty state that capital punishment may be imposed only when the guilt of the person charged is based upon clear and convincing evidence leaving no room for an alternative explanation of the facts. the fact is that kenneth foster did not kill michael lahood, and there is compelling evidence that he did not plan, intend or anticipate that he would be robbed or killed either. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible (please include kenneth fosters inmate number, #999232): - expressing sympathy for the family of michael lahood, and explaining that you are not seeking to excuse the manner of his death or to downplay the suffering it will have caused; - noting that the person who actually shot michael lahood, mauriceo brown, was executed last year; - expressing concern at the use of the law of parties in this case, noting evidence that the shooting was the spontaneous act of mauriceo brown, and that all those involved in the crime have said that there was no conspiracy to rob michael lahood, which would make kenneth foster innocent of capital murder; - noting that the two other accomplices in the car were never prosecuted in this crime, and yet as the evidence stands today their and fosters culpability in it would appear to be similar or the same;

found near a rural road in tomball in harris county, eastern texas, on 15 august 1990. both had been shot. police interviewed a woman, tammy durham, who said that she had asked the teenagers to come to the store where she worked after she saw a black man, wearing cut-off jeans and a dirty shirt and carrying a rolled up newspaper, acting suspiciously near the store. after the teenagers arrived, she saw them approach a black man who was using a payphone outside the store and she said they left with him in their vehicle, after asking for a can of petrol. the police identified lonnie johnson, a 27-year-old man with no criminal record, as a suspect. they obtained a statement from his girlfriend who said that he had arrived at her hotel room in the city of austin in gunar fulks vehicle in the

acted in self-defense after a gun was pulled on him and that he had not known the two teenagers prior to that evening. lonnie johnson was charged with capital murder. the defense lawyer sought to have lonnie johnsons police statement suppressed on the grounds that it was the product of an unlawful arrest. the trial judge agreed and ruled that the statement was not admissible. however, the state appealed and a higher court overturned the trial judges ruling. the trial continued in september 1994. according to the appeal just filed, at the trial the prosecution seemed to argue that either mr johnson did not know the men and feigned car trouble, or the men knew mr johnson in the context of drug dealing. the state argued that mr johnson either shot the men in order to steal fulks truck, or shot the men over money owed for a drug debt. although tammy durham was unable to positively identify lonnie johnson, the prosecution argued that he was the man whom she had seen and suggested that he had been carrying a gun wrapped in the newspaper. johnson was found guilty of capital murder and after the prosecution produced numerous witnesses to testify that the defendant was violent, had a bad temper, and hated whites, he was sentenced to death. after the trial, one of the witnesses who had testified in support of the prosecutions argument that lonnie johnson would poseafter the trial, one of the witnesses who had testified in support of the prosecutions argument that lonnie johnson would pose a future danger to society if allowed to live  a prerequisite for a death sentence in texas  recanted his testimony. in an affidavit, the witness said that: the statements that i made at trial about lonnie displaying a handgun and wanting to kill a motorist were all false. these were statements made to make the district attorney happy, so she would secure my early release from prison. however, the courts have ruled that this witness had not been promised anything in return for testifying, and that his testimony had not affected the outcome of the trial. according to the appeal just filed in the state courts, lonnie johnson continues to maintain that he had been out running on the evening of the shooting. at the store in which tammy durham was working, he had accepted an offer of a lift from the two teenagers. he maintains that he was not wearing cut-off jeans or a dirty shirt or carrying a newspaper. he says that after a few miles in the truck, leroy mccaffrey had produced a gun, saying something like nigger, this is the end of the ride for you, and gunar fulk had pulled the truck over to the side of the road. lonnie johnson claims that he was ordered out of the vehicle, made to lie face down on the ground, and that he was kicked, racially abused and urinated upon. he was then ordered to stand up. johnson says that, although his memory of what happened next is not clear, he remembers managing to wrestle the gun from gunar fulk and shooting him and then leroy mccaffrey, who was armed with a knife and had apparently begun to flee the scene. lonnie johnson says that he then took the truck and fled to austin. at the trial, the defense had little or no evidence that the two teenagers were the aggressors, or that the gun belonged to them rather than johnson. however, according to the appeal just filed, lonnie johnsons lawyer claims that various documents found in the harris county district attorneys office in two of four boxes of evidence to which she was permitted access in early june 2007 are exculpatory and yet were apparently not disclosed to the defense at the time of the trial. the appeal argues that these documents provide evidence of prosecutorial and investigative misconduct in the case; of the unreliability of the ballistics testing done on the alleged murder weapon (the ballistics expert who conducted the testing has been discredited in other cases); that the gun may have belonged to one of the two teenagers; that dna was taken from under fulks fingernails but that any test results had not been released to the defense (any such testing, it is argued, could lend support to johnsons claim that he struggled with fulk and had been urinated on by mccaffrey); and that the black man whom tammy durham had seen outside the store was an individual other than lonnie johnson, potentially discrediting the prosecutions theory of johnson having a gun in a newspaper. the appeal brief claims that the original trial judge, now in private legal practice, has been approached and agreed that such evidence could support lonnie johnsons claim of self-defense. in another case in june 2007, a judge on the texas court of criminal appeals (tcca) noted that the court had ""repeatedly held that flight is evidence of a circumstance from which an inference of guilt may be drawn."" lonnie johnsons newly filed appeal to the tcca provides evidence of the racially charged climate and examples of racist violence in east texas which could help to explain his flight from the crime scene. in this climate, the appeal argues, common sense dictates that if a black person found themselves in a position where they needed to explain the deaths of two white boys, they may be scared that they would not survive long enough to exercise any due process rights afforded them by the united states constitution. amnesty international opposes all executions unconditionally. today, 129 countries are abolitionist in law or practice. in contrast to this, the usa has carried out 1,087 executions since resuming judicial killing in 1977. texas accounts for 397 of these executions. if lonnie johnson is executed, he would become the 100th person convicted in harris county to be put to death since executions resumed in texas in 1982. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: - expressing sympathy for the families of gunar nelson fulk and leroy mccaffrey, explaining that you are not seeking to downplay the suffering their deaths will have caused; - opposing the execution of lonnie johnson; - noting that an appeal just filed calls into question the

like i was the one who killed the officer  they made it clear that we werent leaving until i told them what they wanted to hear. they suggested answers and i would give them what they wanted. they put typed papers in my face and told me to sign them. i did sign them without reading them."" in his 2002 affidavit he said that he couldnt honestly remember what anyone looked like or what different people were wearing. antoine williams, a burger king employee, had just driven into the restaurants car park at the time the shooting occurred. at the trial, he identified troy davis as the person who had shot officer mcphail. in 2002 he stated that this was false, and that he had signed a statement for the police which he could not and did not read: even today, i know that i could not honestly identify with any certainty who shot the officer that night. i couldnt then either. after the officers talked to me, they gave me a statement and told me to sign it. i signed it. i did not read it because i cannot read. at troy daviss trial, i identified him as the person who shot the officer. even when i said that, i was totally unsure whether he was the person who shot the officer. i felt pressured to point at him because he was the one who was sitting in the courtroom. i have no idea what the person who shot the officer looks like."" due to the procedural obstacles facing a death row inmate seeking a hearing on post-conviction evidence, troy davis has had no such hearing on the current state of the witness testimony. at oral arguments in front of a three-judge panel of the federal 11th circuit court of appeals in september 2005, one of the judges expressed concern that troy davis had not been granted a federal hearing to present the post-conviction evidence. she asked, if these people say, i was coerced by the police, how could [the lower federal judge] reject that without a hearing?  she reportedly suggested that without the testimony of the various trial witnesses who had now recanted, the state appeared to have no case. however, in september 2006, the 11th circuit court upheld the federal judges ruling, and on 25 june 2007 the us supreme court refused to intervene. for a full report on this case, see usa: where is the justice for me? the case of troy davis, facing execution in georgia, february 2007, http://web.amnesty.org/library/index/engamr510232007 . background information since the usa resumed executions in 1977, 1,086 prisoners have been put to death, 40 of them in georgia. since the us supreme court approved new death penalty laws in 1976, more than 100 people have been released from death rows around the country on grounds of innocence, many of them in cases in which witness testimony has been shown to have been unreliable. this rate of error is one factor that has contributed to a waning in public support for the death penalty in the usa, with some opinion polls now registering majority support for a moratorium on executions. amnesty international opposes the death penalty regardless of the guilt or innocence of the prisoner. at the same time, it also seeks to ensure that international standards are at least adhered to in those countries which still resort to judicial killing. as the case against troy davis now stands, georgias pursuit of the death penalty contravenes international safeguards which prohibit the execution of anyone whose guilt is not based on ""clear and convincing evidence leaving no room for an alternative explanation of the facts"". recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible, in your own words: - explaining that you are not seeking to condone the murder of officer mark allen mcphail, or to downplay the seriousness of the crime or the suffering caused;

that although he preferred his segregation cell to being held with other inmates, he was lonely; and that he had been abandoned by his family. she said that he had no visitors, he had nobody. she said that knight would confide in her, and would call her mom. she said that she had reached the opinion that his possession of makeshift weapons was an indicator of his boredom rather than of any violent intent. she also said that, although knight did not talk much about the crime, and did not expect sympathy from her, he had said that he was going to take full responsibility for both murders even though robert bradfield had participated in one of them, because he knew that bradfields family would not cope if robert bradfield were to receive the death penalty. she said that she thought that patrick knight had, over time, begun to feel remorse about the crime because he got to the point where he understood really the gravity of what he had done. she did not think that he would be a future danger in prison, so long as he was kept in a controlled structured environment. the defense lawyers had known that the prosecution intended to call risley as a witness and that knight had spoken fondly of her. however, they had never contacted her. in the post-conviction proceedings, cynthia risley stated that she would have been available to talk to the defense. at the federal hearing, the trial lawyer acknowledged that, with hindsight, it would not have been a bad idea probably to interview the jailers who had come into contact with knight. in 2005, the us supreme court handed down a decision, rompilla v. beard, in which it held that even when a capital defendant and his family members have suggested that no mitigating evidence is available, his lawyer is bound to make reasonable efforts to obtain and review material that counsel knows the prosecution will probably rely on as evidence of aggravation at the trials sentencing phase. the rompilla case involved defense counsel who had conducted mitigation investigation, including interviews with the family and mental health experts. however, their investigation had turned up little in mitigation. even so, the supreme court held that the legal representation had been deficient when the lawyers failed to examine the court file on rompillas criminal record that they knew the prosecution would use in seeking a death sentence. in an appeal to the supreme court, knights lawyer argued that the similarities between this case and rompilla are striking. both knights counsel and counsel in rompilla knew that the prosecution intended to use certain evidence as part of its aggravation case during the punishment phase. this evidence [risleys testimony] was readily available and easily investigated. however, the supreme court has refused to take the case. patrick knight comes from a highly dysfunctional family background. alcohol abuse was reportedly common in the family (knight had drunk large amounts of alcohol at the time of the crime). when knight was four years old, he was found at the bottom of a swimming pool with a tricycle on top of him. he required emergency hospitalization and experienced seizures for at least a year afterwards. from the age of nine, he was taken to psychologists on a number of occasions due to behavioral problems. at the age of 13 or 14, he dropped out of school. as patrick knights execution date has approached, his case has gained some notoriety because of his reported decision to collect jokes from which he intends to select one for his final statement. he has stated that by doing this he is not intending any disrespect to the murder victims. in a letter urging the texas board of pardons and paroles to allow the execution to go forward, the randall county criminal district attorney has asserted that knights obscene plan to recite a gag at the moment of execution gives the clemency process a bad name. amnesty international considers that whatever is motivating patrick knight, the texas clemency process has already earned a bad name for itself, having failed to prevent nearly 400 executions in the past 25 years, including of child offenders, prisoners with serious mental disabilities, people denied adequate legal representation, and those whose guilt remained in doubt to the end. there have been 1,080 executions in the usa since judicial killing resumed there in 1977. texas accounts for 394 of these executions. there have been 23 executions in the usa this year, 15 in texas. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: - expressing sympathy for the family of walter and mary ann werner, explaining that you are not seeking to excuse the manner of their deaths or to downplay the suffering caused;

at this time, this rifle was fully loaded shuler placed the barrel of this rifle into his mouth and pulled the trigger. however, he did not realise that the safety catch was on, the rifle did not fire, and he did not try again. the post-conviction court concluded that it was not unreasonable for the trial lawyers not to have presented the jury with this insight into the defendants state of mind at the time of the crime, in light of their strategy not to present mental health evidence. the court added that, even if it had been unreasonable, shuler could not prove that at least one juror would have voted for a life sentence after hearing such evidence. in 2006, the us court of appeals for the fourth circuit said that while evidence of a suicide attempt would have provided an additional piece of the puzzle, it could not say that the state appeal courts ruling was wrong. the jury was presented with evidence of calvin shulers reaction to the recent deaths of his parents. several witnesses testified that he was deeply depressed as a result of this loss. his aunt testified that on one occasion she had found calvin shuler in the cemetery, lying between his parents graves. the crime took place on calvin shulers 31st birthday and the anniversary of his mothers burial. background information today, 129 countries are abolitionist in law or practice. in contrast, there have been 1,080 executions in the usa since judicial killing resumed there in 1977. south carolina accounts for 36 of these executions. there have been 23 executions in the usa so far this year. there are signs that the usa is slowly turning against the death penalty. the 53 executions carried out in 2006 represented the lowest annual total for a decade, and the rate of death sentencing is continuing to drop from its peak in the mid-1990s. the number of people sentenced to death in 2006 was under half of what it was in 1996 and the lowest since 1977. an erosion of the publics belief in the deterrent value of the death penalty, an increased awareness of the frequency of wrongful convictions in capital cases, and a greater confidence that public safety can be guaranteed by life prison terms rather than death sentences have all contributed to the waning of enthusiasm for capital punishment (see usa: the experiment that failed: a reflection on 30 years of executions, january 2007, http://web.amnesty.org/library/index/engamr510112007). a new report issued by the death penalty information center in washington, dc, analyses opinion polling indicating that 58 per cent of the us population believe that it is time for a moratorium on the death penalty; 60 per cent believe that the death penalty is not a deterrent to murder; 87 per cent believe that an innocent person has been executed in the usa recent years; and 69 per cent believe that reforms will not eliminate all wrongful convictions and executions. amnesty international opposes the death penalty unconditionally. the death penalty is a destructive, diversionary and divisive public policy that is not consistent with widely held values. it not only runs the risk of irrevocable error, it is also costly  to the public purse, as well as in social and psychological terms. it tends to be applied discriminatorily on grounds of race and class. it denies the possibility of reconciliation and rehabilitation. it promotes simplistic responses to complex human problems, rather than pursuing explanations that could inform positive strategies. it prolongs the suffering of the murder victims family, and extends that suffering to the loved ones of the condemned prisoner. it diverts resources that could be better used to work against violent crime and assist those affected by it. it is a symptom of a culture of violence, not a solution to it. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: - expressing sympathy for the family of james brooks, explaining that you are not seeking to condone the manner of his death or to downplay the suffering caused;

remaining charges were dropped. robert comer appeared briefly in court at the beginning of his trial in 1988. he then waived his right to be present at the rest of the proceedings. after seven days of evidence being presented, the jury found him guilty on all counts. while presenting the closing argument the prosecutor repeatedly referred to him as a monster, filth and a reincarnation of the devil and compared the crimes to a horror film. on the day of his sentencing, robert comer barricaded himself in his cell. he was forcibly brought out for the court appearance. at the sentencing robert comer was shackled to a wheelchair and, except for a towel around his waist, he was naked. he was slumped to one side and he had visible abrasions on his body. after asking officials in the court whether robert comer was conscious, the judge sentenced him to death. robert comers state appeals were exhausted in 1994 and then in 1997 a district court denied his first federal appeal. robert comer wrote to the state authorities in 1998 stating that he no longer wanted to pursue his appeals. in 2000 the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit noted its grave concerns that a mentally disabled man may be seeking this courts assistance in ending his life and so referred the case back to the district court. the requested hearing was to assess the question of comers competence in waiving his appeal rights, including consideration of his history of irrational behavior and an assessment of the impact that his conditions of confinement may have had on his decision. at the evidentiary hearing before district court judge roslyn silver, a psychiatrist for the defense testified that in his opinion comer was suffering from a major depressive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and shu (segregated housing unit) syndrome. judge silver reviewed comers past and current conditions of confinement. between 1979 and 1984, comer had been incarcerated in california, including some two and a half years in various shus. during this time, class action litigation had established that conditions in these shus were appalling, with debilitaat the evidentiary hearing before district court judge roslyn silver, a psychiatrist for the defense testified that in his opinion comer was suffering from a major depressive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and shu (segregated housing unit) syndrome. judge silver reviewed comers past and current conditions of confinement. between 1979 and 1984, comer had been incarcerated in california, including some two and a half years in various shus. during this time, class action litigation had established that conditions in these shus were appalling, with debilitating effects on the physical and psychological health of the inmates. judge silver found that it was undisputed that mr comer endured most, if not all and possibly worse, of these deplorable conditions while he was confined in the californian facilities. after his arrest robert comer was held in maricopa county jail, where he was kept in a single cell 24 hours a day. a few months after he was sent to death row, robert comer was placed in administrative segregation for disciplinary infractions. he has since been held in isolation in special management units (smus). judge silver stated undeniably, some people do not have the mental health and the adaptive skills to tolerate segregated housing and will immediately or inevitably develop psychiatric illnesses when housed in these units. mr comer, however, has developed the means to cope with the conditions, and he exercises the initiative to ensure that he maintains his mental health while housed in them. the judge stated that despite his conditions [having] had some effect on his decision, they have not had a substantial effect nor have they rendered his decision involuntary. she ruled that his conditions of confinement had left him with no mental disorder. she agreed with the court-appointed expert who confirmed that mr. comers decision was a mature one that has come from introspection. he testified that he regrets what he did; he realizes that he has hurt many people in his life; and hes made the decision that the punishment awarded for the crime is just and hes ready to participate in it. judge silver stated that it is now clear to the court that his decision is a rational one. she emphasized that what is most important to mr. comer is that he has the opportunity to choose. he has made a competent and free choice, which is merely an example of doing what you want to do, embodied in the word liberty. he should be afforded that choice. in 2006, two judges in a three-judge panel from the ninth circuit ruled that comers treatment during his 1988 sentencing shocks the conscience and warrants reversal of his sentence. they stated that: the appearance of this naked, bleeding, shackled man was a severe affront to the dignity and decorum of the judicial proceedings. we have never before read of a man being sentenced to death, or even presented to a court, under such circumstances comer is entitled to a new sentencing hearing. one of the three judges dissented saying that comer had already given up his appeals and the appeals court had no right to reach the merits of comers case. in march 2007, the full ninth circuit court overturned the panel decision and upheld judge silvers ruling that comer was competent to waive his appeals. the phenomenon of prisoners giving up their appeals and volunteering for execution contributes to the arbitrariness of the death penalty

prisoners giving up their appeals and volunteering for execution contributes to the arbitrariness of the death penalty in the usa. if the more than 120 volunteers executed since 1977 had pursued their appeals there is a significant possibility, given the rate of reversible error found in capital cases, that a number of them would have had their death sentences commuted by the appeal courts to prison terms. various factors may contribute to a prisoners decision not to pursue appeals against their death sentence, including mental disorder, physical illness, remorse, bravado, religious belief, a quest for notoriety, the severity of conditions of confinement, prolonged isolation, lack of visits, the alternative of life imprisonment without parole, pessimistic appeal prospects, despair generated by winning and then losing appeals, or the desire to gain a semblance of control over a situation in which the prisoner is otherwise powerless. amnesty international questions whether a decision taken by someone who is under threat of death at the hands of others can be truly voluntary. even if it were, there is no disguising the fact that the state is pursuing a killing that is at least as calculated, and in all likelihood more so, as any murder for which the condemned inmate is being punished. amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases, unconditionally. there have been 1,074 executions in the usa since 1977, 22 of them in arizona. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: - expressing sympathy for the victims of violent crime and acknowledging the suffering it causes; - expressing concern that arizona is set to carry out the execution of robert comer; - voicing your unconditional opposition to the

the hearing was denied after the vote was tied at seven votes to seven. in 2004, a judge on the tennessee supreme court stated that workman had raised valid legal issues concerning whether the death of lt oliver was the result of friendly fire and not his own unlawful acts. specifically, proof that the eyewitness did not see workman shoot the officer and proof that the wound which caused the officers death is inconsistent with the type of wound which would have been caused by a bullet from workmans gun dramatically affect the evidence in this case and, in my opinion, may affect his eligibility for the death penalty. several jurors from the original trial have stated that they would not have voted for a first-degree murder conviction or a death sentence if they had been presented with the evidence that has emerged since the trial. in 2000, with philip workmans execution looming, the daughters of both lt oliver and philip workman united at a press conference to appeal for clemency. the former district attorney of shelby county, the office which prosecuted philip workman, came forward in 2000 to oppose the execution because of the post-conviction evidence. a newly published study, conducted under the auspices of the american bar association (aba), which takes no position for or against the death penalty per se, has found that tennessees death penalty is plagued with serious problems. among these problems, the study found, were inadequate procedures to address innocence claims, inadequate qualification and performance standards for defense counsel, lack of transparency in the clemency process, and racial and geographic disparities in capital sentencing. across the usa, legal challenges to the constitutionality of lethal injection procedures continue amidst evidence that they do not guarantee the humane and painless death that the proponents of lethal injection claim. on 1 february 2007, tennessee's governor, phil bredesen, issued a statement noting that the state authorities had identified deficiencies with our written proceacross the usa, legal challenges to the constitutionality of lethal injection procedures continue amidst evidence that they do not guarantee the humane and painless death that the proponents of lethal injection claim. on 1 february 2007, tennessee's governor, phil bredesen, issued a statement noting that the state authorities had identified deficiencies with our written procedures that raise concerns that they are not adequate to preclude mistakes. in order to ensure that no cloud hangs over the states actions in the future, he said, he issued an executive order suspending executions while the department of correction conducted a comprehensive review of tennessees execution procedures. the commissioner of correction is due to report back to the governor by 2 may, only days before philip workman is due to be put to death. in any event, a cloud hangs over tennessees use of the death penalty, as shown in the new aba report, and as illustrated in philip workmans case. the un safeguards guaranteeing protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty prohibit execution in cases where there is a lack of clear and convincing evidence of the inmates guilt leaving no room for an alternative explanation of the facts. this is clearly a case where execution would contravene this standard. amnesty international opposes the death penalty unconditionally. the usa has executed 1,072 men and women since resuming judicial killing in 1977. tennessee accounts for two of these executions. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible in your own words: - expressing sympathy for the family, friends and colleagues of lieutenant ronald oliver;

executed in texas on 26 april. texas accounts for all but one of the 13 executions carried out in the usa so far this year, and 36 per cent of all executions carried out since judicial killing resumed there in 1977. ryan dickson, who was two weeks past his 18th birthday at the time of the crime, is set to become the 153rd prisoner to be put to death in texas since governor rick perry took office in 2001. this would be one more than the total carried out during the five-year term of his predecessor, george w. bush. according to the evidence at trial, four young males, ryan dickson, his younger brother dane dickson, freddie medina and jeremy brown decided to steal beer from a grocery store in amarillo run by marie surace, 60, and her 61-year-old husband carmelo surace. marie surace was shot and killed during the robbery on 27 november 1994. carmelo suraco was also shot, and died later from his injuries. ryan dickson was charged separately with the two murders. he was tried and sentenced to death in 1997 for the murder of carmelo surace. after the trial, the potter county district attorney indicated that whether or not her office would try ryan dickson for the murder of marie surace would depend on how the first death sentence progressed in the appeal courts. in 2002, after that death sentence ran into problems on appeal (see below), ryan dickson was brought to trial for the murder of marie surace and was again sentenced to death. it is the 1997 death sentence which is due to be carried out on 26 april. the second death sentence is still on appeal. in order to obtain a conviction of capital murder under texas law, the prosecution had to prove that ryan dickson intentionally killed carmelo surace during the course of a robbery. while dickson acknowledged responsibility for the killing, he denied having done so intentionally, arguing that the carmelo surace was shot during a struggle. the testimony of freddie medina and jeremy brown was an important part of the states evidence of intent. brown, for example, testified that before entering the store, dickson had said that he was going to shoot the owners. the jury found ryan dickson guilty of capital murder. after the trial, it emerged that the prosecution had failed to give the defense audiotapes of pre-trial interviews it had conducted, including with jeremy brown. in contrast to his trial testimony, in this interview, indeed during the first 40 to 50 pages of the transcript, brown had said he did not know whether dickson had expressed intent to shoot the store owners. toward the end of the interview, the prosecutor had assured brown that he need not worry about being charged with murder. after a hearing, the trial court concluded in september 2000 that the defense could have used the contents of the tapes particularly to impeach the credibility of jeremy brown, and could have shown that it was only after brown had been informed that he would not be prosecuted that he agreed during the pre-trial interview that ryan dickson had expressed the intent to kill. the trial court concluded that with such evidence, the jury might have reached a different conclusion. it recommended that ryan dickson receive a new trial because of the importance of preserving and maintaining the integrity of the adversarial trial process. the texas court of criminal appeals accepted the courts findings apart from the conclusion that harm from the prosecutions non-disclosure of the tape may be presumed. it allowed the conviction and death sentence to stand. in 2006, the us court of appeals for the fifth circuit expressed its concern about the prosecutions failure to turn over the tapes, stating that the preservation of our civil liberties depends upon the faithful and ethical exercise of power by those who bear the mantle of public trust. where, as here, the actions of officials are contrary to these aspirational principles, whether for improper or guileless reason, courtroom victories may prove pyhrric [gained at too great a cost], and such conduct should attract no judicial approbation. however, having reviewed the state court decision through the deferential lens demanded by federal law, it upheld ryan dicksons capital murder conviction and death sentence. after the jury had convicted ryan dickson at the 1997 trial, the proceedings moved into the sentencing phase. the prosecution focused on the defendants criminal record and his affinity with a local street gang in arguing for a death sentence. the defense presented evidence of the physical and mental abuse that dickson had suffered at the hands of his mother since he was about two years old. even without access to the taped evidence calling into question the reliability of witness testimony against dickson (doubt about guilt has been shown to be a highly mitigating factor in the minds of capital jurors in the usa), the six men and six women on the jury deliberated for nearly three days before reaching their decision. ryan dickson had just turned 18 years old at the time of the murders. if the crime had been committed 17 days earlier, he would now be serving a life sentence. on 24 june 2005, the death sentences of 29 texas death row inmates who were 17 years old at the time of the crimes for which they were convicted were commuted to life imprisonment following the us supreme courts ruling, roper v. simmons, on 1 march 2005. the roper ruling, which amnesty international had long campaigned for, finally brought the usa into line with international law prohibiting the use of the death penalty against people who were under 18 at the time of the crime. the ban on the death penalty for child offenders stems from recognition of the immaturity, impulsiveness, poor judgment and underdeveloped sense of responsibility often associated with youth. but, as noted by the us supreme court in its roper decision, drawing the line at 18 years of age is subject, of course, to the objections always raised against categorical rules. the qualities that distinguish juveniles from adults do not disappear when an individual turns 18. scientific research shows that development of the brain and psychological and emotional maturation continues at least into a persons early 20s. while texas was following the law when it commuted the 29 death sentences in june 2005, it would also be serving the interest of justice to commute the death sentence of ryan dickson, due to his age at the time of the crime as well as the states failure to turn over the pre-trial interview tapes. amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases, unconditionally. today, 128 countries are abolitionist in law or practice. in contrast, there have been 1,070 executions in the usa since it resumed judicial killing in 1977, of which 391 have been carried out in texas. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible in your own words

in indiana on 4 may 2007. he was sentenced to death in 1985 for the murder of juan placencia in 1984. david woods has spent more than half of his life on death row. on 7 april 1984, david woods, gregory sloan and patrick sweet went to the apartment of juan placencia, a 77-year-old acquaintance of woods mother, with a plan to steal his television. according to the states evidence, when the elderly man opened the door, david woods stabbed him repeatedly. a television and some money were stolen. gregory sloan and patrick sweet received prison terms. david woods was 19 at the time of the crime. according to his clemency petition, not presented at woods trial is a litany of graphic, troubling and horrific abuse suffered by woods as a child undiscovered until post-conviction was the magnitude of the abuse. woods was regularly beaten, starved, sadistically tortured, and left to fend for himself throughout his life prior attempts at intervention on woods behalf by the local welfare department were thwarted by a lack of resources and available services... essentially woods became a product of a failed family system and a failed welfare system. some evidence of david woods abusive background was raised at his trial, and the trial court found that his turbulent childhood was a significant mitigating circumstance. post-conviction appeals arguing that his lawyers failed to relate the extent of the abuse have been dismissed under the high bar set by the 1984 us supreme court decision, strickland v. washington. under strickland, an inmate has to prove not only that the lawyers performance was deficient, but also that it affected the outcome of the trial. the strickland decision instructed appeal courts that judicial scrutiny of a defense lawyers performance must be highly deferential, and indulge a strong presumption that the lawyers performance was reasonable. according to the us court of appeals for the seventh circuit in 2005, woods unquestionably came from a tragic background, and the jury had heard enough to be left in no doubt that woods had a truly horrific childhood. it noted that the jury was told how the defendants mother and the various men in her life took sadistic pleasure in physically abusing woods and his siblings. in addition, the children frequently witnessed [the mother] herself being mercilessly beaten by these men. it recalled that at one point woods mother became the mama of a local motorcycle gang and regularly hosted wild parties at her home, during which much sex and drinking went on in the presence of the children. one evening, [the mother] offered two of her daughters (aged 13 and 11) to some of the bikers. david woods father had abandoned the family when the boy was a few yearaccording to the us court of appeals for the

told how the defendants mother and the various men in her life took sadistic pleasure in physically abusing woods and his siblings. in addition, the children frequently witnessed [the mother] herself

boy was a few years old, and after that the family moved around the country, often living in very unhealthy and impoverished conditions. the jury also heard some expert evidence on the effects that the abuse had had on david woods, including depression, anger and emotional problems. a social worker, for example, testified that after he was placed in foster care, woods was aggressive towards other children and against himself. one at least one occasion, he inflicted knife wounds to his own stomach and arms. the seventh circuit acknowledged that the evidence discovered after the trial had undeniably revealed additional, often unpleasant details about woods upbringing and the nature of the various abuses he sufferedfor example, woods points to additional details of his mothers neglect, such as chaining the refrigerator shut and giving food only as a reward for stealing. other unsavory factsprovided additional detail regarding woodss and his siblings physical and sexual abuse. however, it concluded that woodss claim boils down to the contention that his counsel did not present enough mitigating evidence, and that even if his lawyers performance was deficient, woods cannot satisfy the prejudice prong of strickland. there is evidence that david woods has borderline mental retardation, and an expert recently noted the clear evidence of brain damage. in march 2007, the indiana supreme court ruled that the evidence did not support a finding that david woods had actual retardation which would render his execution unconstitutional. this issue is now in federal court. there are also ongoing challenges to indianas lethal injection procedures. david woods has been on death row for more than two decades. the us supreme court has not ruled whether prolonged confinement on death row violates the us constitution, but individual justices have raised concerns. in 1995, justice stevens wrote that executing a prisoner who had been on death row for 17 years arguably negated any deterrent or retributive justification for the punishment, supposedly the two main social purposes of the death penalty. if these goals no longer existed, he suggested, the outcome would be patently excessive and cruel. in 2002, in the case of a florida inmate who had been on death row for about 27 years, justice breyer stated that if executed, the prisoner would have been punished both by death and also by more than a generation spent in death rows twilight. it is fairly asked whether such punishment is both unusual and cruel."" david woods is due to be interviewed by the five-member indiana parole board on 20 april at the indiana state prison. the board will conduct a public hearing in indianapolis on the morning of 23 april before voting on clemency later that day. the boards non-binding recommendation will then be forwarded to the governor. amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases, unconditionally. since the usa resumed judicial killing in 1977, 1,070 inmates have been put to death. indiana accounts for 17 of these executions. capital justice in the usa is marked by arbitrariness, discrimination and error. a recently published study of indianas death penalty system noted that it had aptly been called indianas other lottery. the indiana report, conducted under the american bar associations (aba) death penalty project, stated that we are deeply troubled that [the death penalty] is not imposed in a fair or consistent manner upon only the very worst offenders who have committed the very worst of offences. among the specific problems it identified were inadequate qualification standards for defense lawyers in capital cases. the aba neither supports nor opposes the death penalty, although it supports a moratorium on executions. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible in your own words (please include david woods inmate number, #851765): - expressing your sympathy for the family and friends of juan placencia, explaining that you are not seeking to condone the manner of his death, or to downplay the suffering caused; - noting that david woods was only 19 years old at the time of the crime, and emerging from what the us court of appeals has described as a tragic and truly horrific childhood of abuse and neglect; - noting evidence that he has borderline mental retardation and brain damage; - noting that he has been on death row for more than two decades, adding that us supreme court justices have questioned whether an execution in such circumstances would be constitutional; - noting that the power of executive clemency is not constrained in the way that the judiciary may be, and can take into account all aspects of a case which the courts have been unable to unwilling to

sentence to life imprisonment on the grounds that he has mental retardation. in 2002, in atkins v virginia, the us supreme court outlawed the execution of people with retardation. the court did not define retardation, although it pointed to the definition used by the american association of mental retardation (aamr). under such a definition, mental retardation is a disability, manifested before the age of 18, characterized by significantly sub-average intellectual functioning (generally indicated by an iq of less than 70) accompanied by limitations in two or more adaptive skill areas such as communication, self-care, work, and functioning in the community. the supreme court noted that not all people who claim to be mentally retarded will be so impaired as to fall within the range of mentally retarded offenders about whom there is a national consensus. the court left it up to individual states to develop appropriate ways to comply with the ruling. this opened the door to further inconsistency in the application of the death penalty in the usa. in an assessment in april 2003, clinical psychologist dr george denkowski, hired by the state, concluded that james clark had retardation  he assessed clarks iq at 65 and concluded that he had adaptive skill deficits in three areas (health and safety, social, and work). this was the fifth post-atkins case that dr denkowski had worked on  in one other case he found that the defendant had mental retardation, in the other three he concluded that they did not have this level of impairment. dr denkowski found that robert smith had mental retardation, and an iq of 63. the harris county prosecutor accepted this, citing denkowskis expertise, and smiths death sentence was commuted. in 2006 and 2007 dr denowski found that death row inmates darrell carr, demetrius simms, and exzavier stevenson had mental retardation. in each case, the harris county prosecutor accepted dr denkowskis finding and the death sentences were commuted. in two other harris county cases, those of coy wesbrook in 2006 and brian davis in 2004, dr denkowski concluded that the inmate did not have retardation. they remain on death row. in james clarks case, the denton county prosecution did not accept dr denkowskis finding of retardation. instead it hired another psychologist, dr thomas allen. he concluded that clark was faking retardation to avoid execution. the defense had an assessment done by dr denis keyes, an expert whose studies were among those cited in the in james clarks case, the denton county prosecution did not accept dr denkowskis finding of retardation. instead it hired another psychologist, dr thomas allen. he concluded that clark was faking retardation to avoid execution. the defense had an assessment done by dr denis keyes, an expert whose studies were among those cited in the atkins ruling. dr keyes concluded that james clark has retardation (and an iq of 68). he noted that dr denkowskis findings in clarks case were ""credible and correct"". in contrast to this, dr keyes noted that dr allen ""did no standardized testing (which is required for diagnosis and for ruling out a diagnosis)."" neither dr keyes nor dr denkowski found that james clark had faked his mental retardation during their assessments, something that these experts specifically tested for. an evidentiary hearing was held in the trial court in 2003, during which james clark was shackled, handcuffed and forced to wear an electro-shock stun belt. when his lawyer asked for the stun belt to be removed, the judge refused. the judge deferred to dr allens conclusions, rejecting those of drs keyes and denkowski. she held that an iq score of 74 that clark achieved in 1983 in youth custody was ""the most reliable indicator"" of his iq because he then had no reason to fake retardation, whereas a finding now would determine whether he was executed or not. the judge ruled that the 1983 score did not meet the aamrs first criterion (iq 70 or under) of mental retardation, even though with the generally accepted margin of error, a score of 74 falls within the range of 69-79. in addition, dr james flynn, an expert on assessing iq scores to take account of changes over time, has concluded that the best estimate of james clarks 1983 score in terms of up-to-date norms would be about 68.57 (that is, very similar to dr keyes finding), and it is almost certain that [clarks iq] is not 70 or above. in another post-atkins case in 2006, the importance of the so-called flynn effect and the margin of error was recognized by the texas court of criminal appeals (tcca), when it remanded a case of an inmate with an iq assessed at 81 to the trial court level for further evidentiary development on the retardation question. in march 2004 in james clarks case, the tcca upheld the trial judges findings. without holding any further evidentiary hearings, the federal courts have upheld the death sentence, with the supreme court refusing to take the case in february 2007. background information nearly five years on, the texas legislature has not enacted a law to comply with the atkins ruling. in the absence of legislation, the tcca has taken it upon itself to issue guidelines for trial courts in making retardation determinations. in february 2004, the tcca wrote: the texas legislature has not yet enacted legislation to carry out the atkins mandate [w]e must act during this legislative interregnum to provide the bench and bar with temporary judicial guidelines in addressing atkins claims. it asked: is there, and should there be, a mental retardation bright-line exemption from our states maximum statutory punishment?... [w]e decline to answer that normative question without significantly greater assistance from the citizenry acting through its legislature. in february 2007, the tcca emphasized that its 2004 guidelines were intended only to be guidelines for trial courts to work with until the legislature was to reconvene and establish conclusively both the substantive laws and the procedures that would bring our codes into compliance with the mandate issued by atkins. yet to this day, no such guidance has been provided by the legislature. amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases, unconditionally. today, 128 countries are abolitionist in law or practice. in contrast, there have been 1,069 executions in the usa since it resumed judicial killing in 1977, of which 390 (37 per cent) have been carried out in texas. eleven of the 12 executions in the usa so far in 2007 have been carried out in texas. one hundred and fifty-one people have been put to death in texas since rick perry became governor in 2001. the five-year governorship of his predecessor, george w. bush, saw 152 executions. there are 385 men and women on death row in texas. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible in your own words (please include james clarks inmate number, #999095): - expressing sympathy for the family of shari catherine crews, and explaining that you are not seeking to condone the manner of her death or to deny the suffering caused; - noting that two experts, including dr george denkowski hired by the state in a number of other cases in which his assessments for and against findings of retardation have been accepted, concluded that james clark has mental retardation, and should be exempted from execution under the atkins v virginia decision; - noting that these experts conducted thorough assessments, and ruled out malingering; - expressing concern that texas has still not enacted legislation to comply with the atkins ruling, and decisions on mental retardation are being made on the basis of temporary judicial guidelines formulated by the texas court of criminal appeals, which has expressed concern at the lack of legislative guidance; - noting that assessing mental retardation is not an exact science, and that in this regard, executive clemency is an important failsafe against error and inconsistency, especially in the absence of legislation; - calling for the clemency for james clark. appeals to: rissie owens, presiding officer board of pardons and paroles executive clemency section 8610 shoal creek boulevard, austin, tx 78757",0,"brian davis"

march. he was sentenced to death in 1998 for the murder of jose cobo in 1997. forty-year-old us air force captain jose cobo was shot during a carjacking in san antonio on 11 march 1997. three people were convicted in connection with the crime: christopher suaste pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of aggravated robbery in return for a sentence of 35 years in prison. he testified against his co-defendants, vincent gutierrez and randy arroyo. these two were tried jointly after the trial judge refused their request to be tried separately. both were sentenced to death. vincent gutierrez was 18 years old at the time of the murder. randy arroyo was aged 17. randy arroyos death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment in june 2005 following the us supreme courts roper v. simmons ruling three months earlier, which brought the usa into line with international law prohibiting the use of the death penalty against people who were under 18 at the time of the crime. amnesty international had long campaigned for this outcome, and welcomed the roper ruling. the prohibition on the death penalty for child offenders stems from recognition of the immaturity, impulsiveness, poor judgment and underdeveloped sense of responsibility often associated with youth. but, as noted by the us supreme court in its roper decision, drawing the line at 18 years of age is subject, of course, to the objections always raised against categorical rules. the qualities that distinguish juveniles from adults do not disappear when an individual turns 18. sixteen years earlier, four supreme court justices had noted that: insofar as age 18 is a necessarily arbitrary social choice as a point at which to acknowledge a persons maturity and responsibility, given the different developmental rates of individuals, it is in fact a conservative estimate of the dividing line between adolescence and adulthood. many of the psychological and emotional changes that an adolescent experiences in maturing do not actually occur until the early 20s. scientific research shows that development of the brain and psychological and emotional maturation continues at least into a persons early 20s. historically other countries have recognized this. a study of the death penalty in the 1960s found that out of 101 countries which then set a minimum age for the death penalty, 17 set that minimum age at 18 years, and 77 set it at age 20. paraguay, for example, set its minimum age at 22, greece 21, hungary and bulgaria 20, and greece 21. all have now abolished the death penalty. cuba, on the other hand, retains capital punishment, but restricts it to offenders over 20 years old. at the 1998 trial, the jurors found the two defendants equally culpable and handed down death sentences. today, at least six of the jurors have signed affidavits supporting the argument presented in vincent gutierrezs clemency petition that it is unfair that he is facing execution while randy arroyo is not. amnesty international emphasizes that the power of executive clemency exists to compensate for the rigidity of the law. while texas was following the law when it commuted the death sentence of randy arroyo, it would no less be serving the interest of justice and the perception of justice and fairness to commute the death sentence of vincent gutierrez, due to his age at the time of the same crime for which arroyo was convicted. at the trial, vincent gutierrezs lawyers presented evidence that he was a follower who was easily influenced by others, and that he had been a polite, quiet and non-violent child. however, their investigation appears to have been limited, and they did not discover, for example, available evidence of mental illness and sexual abuse within his family that they might have used to develop mitigating evidence on behalf of their client. for example, vincent gutierrezs older brother had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and there is evidence that his father and younger brother also suffered from this serious mental illness. vincent gutierrezs current lawyer has raised a claim of possible prosecutorial misconduct evidence of which has only recently emerged, in relation to the states use of witnesses at the 1998 trial. christopher suastes testimony alone was legally insufficient under texas law, which prohibits a conviction from being based upon the testimony of an accomplice in the absence of corroborating evidence. the prosecution also presented the testimony of sean lowe, a friend of suaste and an acquaintance of gutierrez and arroyo. lowe was apparently present during the planning of the car theft, and had assisted in transporting gutierrez and arroyo before and after the crime. although the trial court ruled that sean lowe was not an accomplice as a matter of law, his credibility was nevertheless in question, including because at the time he was facing proceedings in relation to a burglary offence. however, the prosecution presented another witness, antonio pina, who was not associated with the defendants, and who had no apparent incentive to adjust his testimony in favor of the state. antonio pina was subsequently convicted of theft in another case and sentenced to imprisonment. in august 2005, he wrote to the lead prosecutor in the gutierrez/arroyo trial (now a state court judge) asking for his assistance in reducing his sentence. in his letter, antonio pina referred back to the meeting that he and the prosecutor had on that case, and stated: you mention[ed] to me if i ever needed a favor you would help me. vincent gutierrezs lawyer is arguing that this statement suggests that the prosecutor had made some kind of offer to pina in return for his testimony at the 1998 trial. any such offer was not disclosed to the defense and the evidence of it was not revealed until october 2005: however, the prosecution presented another witness, antonio pina, who was not associated with the defendants, and who had no apparent incentive to adjust his testimony in favor of the state. antonio pina was subsequently convicted of theft in another case and sentenced to imprisonment. in august 2005, he wrote to the lead prosecutor

cindy johnson, white; and teresa ishman, black. during the robbery, claude shaffer was shot. he died from a single bullet wound. both assailants had fired their weapons. cindy johnson was interviewed by police at the scene, but teresa ishman left. she returned and gave her name as teresa mcgee, but was not interviewed at the scene. defense lawyers later tried to locate teresa mcgee, but to no avail, and she played no part in the trials. willie williams was brought to trial first. he pleaded guilty to killing claude shaffer. he said that nichols had fired first but had not hit shaffer. he said that nichols was already out the door and i had the gun still pointed back toward the old man. i thought [shaffer] was coming up on me and i just fired. the state presented the medical examiners evidence in support of its theory that williams had shot shaffer. the prosecutor said to the jury: willie williams is the individual who shot and killed claude shaffer. that is all there is to it. it is scientific. it is consistent. it is complete. it is final, and it is in evidence there is only one bullet that could possibly have done it and that was willie williams nichols is out the door. the law of parties formed no part of the jury instruction. this is the texas law under which the distinction between principal actor and accomplice in a crime is abolished and each defendant may be held equally culpable. williams was sentenced to death in january 1981. he was executed on 20 january 1995. joseph nichols was brought to trial in july 1981. the state argued that regardless of who fired the fatal shot, nichols was guilty under the law of parties. the defense argued abandonment, that is that the murder had occurred after nichols had left the crime. the jury found him guilty of capital murder, but a mistrial was declared after the jury was unable to reach a sentencing verdict. following the trial, the prosecution interviewed some of the jurors and learned that their doubts about whether joseph nichols had been the person who had fired the fatal shot had left them unable to agree on the death penalty. joseph nichols was retried in february 1982 by the same prosecutor. the jury was instructed on the law of parties, but this time the prosecution primarily argued that nichols had fired the fatal shot. it did not base this about-turn on any additional investigation. the prosecutor argued that willie could not have shot [shaffer] [nichols] fired the fatal bullet and killed the man in cold blood and he should answer for that. the prosecution relied heavily on the testimony of cindy johnson, arguing to the jury: ill tell you that it was [nicholss] hand that did the killing. how do you know that? cindy saw it. she told you. additionally, the state presented evidence from the same medical examiner as in williams trial to support this new theory that the bullet came from nicholss position in the store. in march 1982, the jury voted for a death sentence. in 1992, a federal judge ruled that the prosecution had presented false evidence by changing its argument from nicholss first trial to his retrial (nichols ii). judge david hittner said: the state argued, the jury found, and the court accepted the determination in the williams trial that williams was the triggerman, not just a party to the offence. that fact was established as the truth. this court has concluded that the prosecutor in charge of nichols ii offered evidence and argued to the jury and court that nichols was the triggerman. by prior judicial determination, the evidence submitted was necessarily false. accordingly, this court finds that the prosecutor in charge of nichols ii knowingly used false evidence to obtain the conviction and sentence in nichols ii. judge hittner concluded that the due process boundary upon prosecutorial misconduct and the appearance of basic fairness derived from that boundary command a determination that, in a criminal prosecution, the state is constitutionally [barred] from obtaining a fact finding in one trial and seeking and obtaining an inconsistent fact finding in another trial. he said that williams and nichols cannot both be guilty of firing the same bullet because physics will not permit it. he ordered that nichols be released or retried. however, the state appealed and the fifth circuit court of appeals overturned judge hittners ruling. in 1992, judge hittner had ordered the state to produce all its files in the case. these revealed that teresa mcgee was in fact teresa ishman; that the state had known her true identity before nicholss trials; had known that she would not be at the houston address provided to the defense; and had interviewed her in the county jail prior to extraditing her to louisiana on a shoplifting charge (the reason ishman had assumed a false name). her statements during those interviews threw doubt on the reliability of cindy johnsons testimony. for example, she claimed that johnson could not have seen the fatal shots fired because she had been hiding in the bathroom at the time. judge hittner had not considered the non-disclosure of evidence because it had not been ruled on in state court. the issue was returned to the state courts which concluded that the prosecution had failed to inform nicholss lawyers about the location and true identity of teresa ishman, and that her testimony would have in some respects been favorable to nichols, but that the suppression of her name and identity had not affected the outcome of the trial. the federal courts have upheld the death sentence. in 1995, a us supreme court justice wrote that executing a prisoner who had been on death row for 17 years  eight years less than joseph nichols has suffered  arguably negated any deterrent or retributive justification for the punishment. in 2002, in the case of an inmate who had been on death row for about 27 years, another justice wrote of this extraordinarily long confinement under sentence of death, a confinement that extends from late youth to later middle age. if executed, the justice stated, the prisoner would have been punished both by death and also by more than a generation spent in death rows twilight. it is fairly asked whether such punishment is both unusual and cruel"", in violation of the us constitution. since the usa resumed judicial killing in 1977, there have been 1,063 executions, of which 384 (36 per cent) have been carried out in texas. in 2006, texas carried out 24 executions, five times as many as the next highest state total. five of the six executions in the usa so far in 2007 have been carried out in texas. race, particularly race of murder victim, has consistently been shown to be a factor in us death sentencing. similar to the national picture, 75 per cent of those executed in texas since 1977 were put to death for crimes involving white victims, and 21 per cent were of black defendants convicted of killing white victims. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible (please quote joseph nichols prison number, #709, in appeals): - expressing sympathy for the family of claude shaffer, and explaining that you are not seeking to condone the manner of his death or to downplay the suffering caused;

executed in texas on 27 february 2007. he was sentenced to death in 1982 for the murder of michael mozingo earlier that year. donald miller was 19 years old at the time of the crime. he has been on death row for nearly 25 years. michael mozingo and another man, kenneth whitt, were robbed and shot dead on 2 february 1982. three men were charged with the crime: eddie segura, danny woods and donald miller. before donald millers trial, eddie segura pleaded guilty to aggravated robbery and became a key witness against donald miller. segura was sentenced after millers trial, to 25 years in prison. before millers trial, danny woods, who admitted to shooting kenneth whitt, pleaded guilty to murder and was sentenced to life imprisonment. woods did not testify at millers trial. donald miller, according to his trial attorney (now deceased), faced a death penalty trial after he refused a plea bargain of a life sentence in return for a guilty plea. following an evidentiary hearing in 2002, a federal district court judge ruled in 2004 that the prosecution had withheld exculpatory evidence at donald millers trial, in violation of the us supreme courts 1963 ruling, brady v. maryland. the federal judge found that the withheld evidence was material to the question of sentencing: that is, the sentence might have been different if the evidence had not been suppressed. the evidence in question related to statements made by witnesses prior to the trial. the federal judge noted that pre-trial statements made by ray mccall, who was the brother of eddie seguras then-girlfriend, were inconsistent with his trial testimony against miller and could have been used by the defense to undermine mccalls credibility. at the 2002 evidentiary hearing, millers trial lawyer had described mccalls testimony as the most devastating testimony in the whole trial in that it depicted donald miller as a cold-blooded and remorseless killer. the federal judge also noted inconsistencies in the statements of another witness, archie morris, who was ray mccalls grandfather. prior to the trial, morris had told investigators that he only owned a .22 caliber handgun and had not given it to donald miller. at the trial, however, he testified that on the day of the crime miller had borrowed from him the .38 caliber gun used in the shooting. in addition, the state suppressed affidavits from four people who did not testify at the trial. robert white, for example, stated that danny woods had told him that after one of the victims had been killed with a shotgun, either danny or the guy with danny then reached down into his boot and pulled a .38 pistol and shot the other guy when he started to run. millers appeal lawyers have argued that this was important because it wasin addition, the state suppressed affidavits from four people who did not testify at the trial. robert white, for example, stated that danny woods had told him that after one of the victims had been killed with a shotgun, either danny or the guy with danny then reached down into his boot and pulled a .38 pistol and shot the other guy when he started to run. millers appeal lawyers have argued that this was important because it was established at trial that miller was not wearing boots at the time of the murders. whites affidavit also states that the day after the murders, woods had denied that miller was involved. the federal judge found that the affidavits indicated that woods may have killed both victims and that segura was armed at the time. on appeal to the us court of appeals to the fifth circuit, the state argued that district courts decision was wrong, and millers appeal lawyers countered that the suppressed evidence not only went to the question of the reliability of the sentence, but also to the question of millers guilt. the fifth circuit panel rejected millers arguments about guilt and overturned the district courts ruling on sentencing. one of the three judges dissented, arguing that the various pieces of evidence, taken together, could have raised a reasonable doubt in a juror when deciding whether to vote for a death sentence. on mccalls testimony, the dissenting judge noted that although mccall was generally impeached on cross-examination as a dishonest criminal who was not always truthful with the police during the investigation, there is a significant difference between evidence that a witness is generally not truthful and specific evidence that he gave inconsistent statements with respect to the subject of his crucial testimony.the defence was not able to cross-examine mccall about his [pre-trial] statements the judge said that mccall provided important corroboration of seguras account of the crime, which portrayed miller as a leader in the killings, so weakening his testimony could have cast doubt on whether miller planned the killings and was an actual shooter. similarly, archie morris testimony had provided critical corroborationlinking miller to one of the murder weapons and yet the credibility of his testimony had gone unchallenged at the trial. in texas, a jury can only pass a death sentence if it unanimously agrees that the defendant would likely commit future criminal acts of violence if allowed to live, even in prison (the future dangerousness question). the dissenting fifth circuit judge noted that undermining the prosecutions portrayal of donald miller as ringleader and gunman in the crime could have affected the jurys finding that he posed a future danger. a study published by the texas defender service in 2004 concluded that predictions of future dangerousness in the texas death penalty system were wrong in a majority of cases, and that basing capital sentencing decisions on predictions of future dangerousness is unjustifiable  and not only because a system that so allots punishment in effect punishes defendants for offences they may or may not commit, thus violating the fundamental legal principle that the accused is innocent until proven guilty. during his nearly 25 years on death row, donald miller is reported never to have been disciplined for violent or aggressive behaviour towards other inmates, guards, or anyone else. he was reportedly once accused of assaulting a a study published by the texas defender service in 2004 concluded that predictions of

youve seen pictures of him. what makes the difference between jesus christ and charles manson? the texas court of criminal appeals would later dismiss claims that such outbursts were evidence of the need for a competency hearing, stating that they were timely, topical, and logically related to the questions and answers offered during the examination of other witnesses. the defense presented drs arambula and zuelzer, who testified that in their opinion moore had been suffering from serious mental illness at the time of the crime and that he had been legally insane as a result. the defense also presented lay witnesses, detailing moores difficult family life, his commitment to a mental hospital and treatment with psychotropic medication during his adolescence, and his increasing paranoia as a young adult. in rebuttal, the prosecution presented two doctors who testified that in their opinion johnathan moore did not suffer from a serious mental illness and was legally sane at the time of the shooting. the jury rejected the insanity defense and convicted moore of capital murder. at the sentencing phase, johnathan moore again sought to discharge his lawyers, and represented himself for the first two days of proceedings. the defense lawyers sought a competency hearing, but without recalling the mental health experts, who therefore never testified at any stage on the question of moores competence to stand trial. the judge rejected the motion, the sentencing continued, and johnathan moore was sentenced to death after the jury found that he would pose a future risk to society if allowed to live (a prerequisite for a death sentence in texas). among the prosecutors arguments for execution was that the jury could consider moores youth as a reason to hand down a death sentence. drs arambula and zuelzer later testified at an evidentiary hearing during the appeals process. although they had had only limited opportunity to observe johnathan moore during the trial, after hearing the trial lawyers testimony about his conduct, dr zuelzer concluded that moore had become incompetent during the proceedings. according to a 2005 appeal brief, dr arambula testified that under a situation in which moores paranoia and delusions caused him to become so suspicious of his attorneys that he refused to communicate with them, kept his head down, flipped through magazines and books during the trial, and eventually chose to represent himself, he [arambula] could have testified that mdrs arambula and zuelzer later testified at an evidentiary hearing during the appeals process. although they had had only limited opportunity to observe johnathan moore during the trial, after hearing the trial lawyers testimony about his conduct, dr zuelzer concluded that moore had become incompetent during the proceedings. according to a 2005 appeal brief, dr arambula testified that under a situation in which moores paranoia and delusions caused him to become so suspicious of his attorneys that he refused to communicate with them, kept his head down, flipped through magazines and books during the trial, and eventually chose to represent himself, he [arambula] could have testified that moore was incompetent. the appeal courts have upheld the conviction and death sentence, rejecting the claim, among others, that the defense lawyers were ineffective for having not presented their experts in seeking a competency hearing. johnathan moores execution is scheduled to take place on the 30th anniversary of the resumption of executions in the usa. the modern era of judicial killing in the usa began on 17 january 1977 with the execution of gary gilmore in utah. there have now been 1,057 executions, of which 379 (36 per cent) have been carried out in texas. texas has executed nearly four times as many people as the next leading death penalty state, virginia. although there is evidence of opinion turning against the death penalty in the usa (see usa: new years resolution: end a cruel and outdated punishment, 21 december 2006,",0,"gary gilmore"

that angel diaz never told him that he was the gunman; and that he did not know from his communication with diaz who had shot joseph nagy. he states that his testimony to the contrary was motivated by anger at angel diaz and a desire to gain favor from the state on his own murder charge. ralph gajus had testified at the trial that he had not been promised anything in return for his testimony. however, at his own sentencing a police officer had testified about the assistance gajus had provided to the state in the diaz case. during the jurys deliberations at the trial of angel diaz, the jurors requested copies of the testimony of ralph gajus, but the judge refused, instructing the jury to rely on its recollection of what he had said. the jury returned a guilty verdict. ralph gajuss recantation further calls into question the reliability of their verdict. at the sentencing, it was argued in mitigation against a death sentence that angel diaz had only been an accomplice to the crime, but no new evidence of this was presented. research in the usa has shown that residual doubt about guilt is a highly mitigating factor in the minds of capital jurors. although the jury recommended a death sentence for angel diaz, they did so only by eight votes to four, indicating possible residual doubt in the minds of the jurors even with the testimony of ralph gajus. without it, it is possible that more of the jurors would have voted against a death sentence. in post-conviction proceedings, evidence not raised at the trial has been raised about angel diazs childhood of abuse and mental problems, and his addiction to drugs from the age of 16. it has also been claimed that the prosecution failed to disclose evidence that it was angel toro who shot joseph nagy. in a memorandum dated 6 february 1984, the prosecutor wrote: at some point, all three subjects pulled out guns and announced a robbery. shots were fired. defendant toro apparently grabbed gina fredericks around the neck and took her back to the area of the office where the safe was located. apparently, victim nagy came out of the office at that time. defendant toro shot nagy once in the chest causing his death. testimony given by people who are themselves in custody or facing criminal prosecution has been shown to be frequently unreliable. research at northwestern university in illinois has revealed that the use of such informants was among the three most prevalent factors in wrongful capital convictions in the united states. a review of 111 such cases from 1973 to 2004 in the usa found the use of false testimony in 46 per cent of the cases. the commission on capital punishment, set up by the governor of illinois after he imposed a moratorium on executions in 2000, examined the question of such testimony. the commissions april 2002 report concluded that, even with stringent safeguards on the use of such evidence, the potential for testimony of questionable reliability remains high, and imposing the death penalty in such cases appears ill-advised. the california commission on the fair administration of justice has recently issued its recommendation on the use of informant testimony. the commission, established by the california state senate to examine the causes of wrongful convictions, and to make recommendations to ensure the fair and reliable administration of criminal justice in california, has recommended that the legislature adopt a law barring the use of in-custody informant testimony in criminal trials without independent corroborating evidence. a recent study conducted under the auspices of the american bar associations death penalty moratorium implementation project identified serious problems in floridas capital justice system, including the high number of people released from death row on the grounds of innocence (22 since 1973  more than illinois, where a moratorium resulted), the continued existence of racial and geographic disparities, the fact that unanimity is not required in jury sentencing decisions, and the failure to give sufficient weight to the mitigating effects of serious mental disability. further recommended action: please continue to send appeals based on the original ua and this new information, to arrive as quickly as possible: - expressing sympathy for the family of joseph nagy, who was killed in 1979, and explaining that you are not seeking to downplay the seriousness of this crime or the suffering caused; - opposing the execution of angel nieves diaz, noting evidence calling into question his competency to stand trial and represent himself; - noting the disparity in sentencing in this case, with one defendant receiving a life sentence and another death, despite conflicting evidence about who was the gunman; - noting that ralph gajus, a key prosecution witness at the trial, has now recanted his testimony against angel diaz, calling into further doubt the reliability of the jurys verdict; - noting that four of the jurors did not vote for the death penalty, indicating a possible residual doubt in their minds about the defendants guilt, and suggesting that without the testimony of ralph gajus more of the jurors might have voted against a death sentence; - noting that recent research has found serious problems with floridas capital justice system, including geographic and racial disparities, and the lack of a requirement for unanimity in jury sentencing decisions;

executed in texas on 8 november 2006. he was sentenced to death in 1993 for the murder of benjamin garza during a carjacking in houston in july 1992. willie shannon was 19 years old at the time of the crime. he maintains that he did not intend to kill benjamin garza, but that the gun went off during a struggle with the victim. at the sentencing phase of his trial, the state presented testimony that willie shannon had raped a woman on the day of the carjacking. the prosecution used the evidence to attempt to show that shannon would be a future danger to society if allowed to live, a prerequisite for a death sentence in texas. attempts in recent years to have the forensic evidence from the alleged sexual assault dna tested were unsuccessful after the authorities stated that the houston police department crime laboratory had destroyed the evidence in 1997. after the texas court of criminal appeals had denied willie shannons appeals against his conviction and death sentence, the case moved into the federal courts. after an appeal was filed in the case in march 2002, the state of texas moved to have the federal district court reject the petition because it had been filed too late under the time limits for filing federal appeals required under the anti-terrorism and effective death penalty act (aedpa) of 1996. the act placed new restrictions on prisoners raising claims of constitutional violations in habeas corpus petitions. it imposed time limits on the raising of constitutional claims, restricted the federal courts ability to review state court decisions, placed limits on federal courts granting and conducting evidentiary hearings, and prohibited successive appeals except in narrow circumstances. in july 2005, the district court granted the states motion to dismiss willie shannons petition. in april 2006, the us court of appeals for the fifth circuit affirmed the district courts ruling, stating that equitable remedies are not intended for those who sleep on their rights. willie shannons appeal lawyers have challenged the quality of the defense representation that he was provided at his 1993 trial. they claim that the trial counsel failed to conduct an adequate investigation into possible mitigating evidence to present at the sentencing phase of the trial, and failed to present a single witness at the sentencing. the appeals indicate that the jury was thus left unaware of evidence of willie shannons learning disabilities and his dysfunctional home life. dismissing the appeals as filed in an untimely manner under the aedpa means that the issue of whether the trial counsels performance fell below constitutional standards has not been considered by the federal courts. willie shannons lawyers are seeking a stay of execution from the us supreme court on the grounds that there is another case pending before the court which could impact his case. on 31 october 2006, the court heard oral arguments in the case of lawrence v. florida, and will now consider whether florida death row inmate gary lawrence's appeal in federal court was filed in a timely manner under the aedpa. there is a difference of opinion on this issue of timing of appeals under the aedpa among the federal circuits of the us court of appeals. willie shannons appeal for a stay of execution, noting that the us supreme court will likely decide the lawrence case by june 2007 at the latest, states: staying mr. shannons november 8, 2006, execution date will cause only minimal delay in the event this court decides all questions against lawrence. the failure to stay mr. shannons execution will obviously result in irreparable harm should lawrence prevailbecause a ruling in favor of lawrencewould change the disposition of mr. shannons case and permit federal habeas review of his trial attorneys failure to present a single witness in the punishment phase of the case. background information signing the aedpa into law on 24 april 1996, president bill clinton had stated that from now on, criminals sentenced to death for their vicious crimes will no longer be able to use endless appeals to delay their sentences. in 1998, following his mission to the usa, the united nations special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, wrote that: the enactment of the 1996 anti-terrorism and effective death penalty act[has] further jeopardized the implementation of the right to a fair trial as provided for in the [international covenant on civil and political rights] and other international instruments. in 1997, a leading us lawyer wrote: the provisions of the anti-terrorism and effective death penalty act of 1996 restricting the power of federal courts to correct constitutional error in criminal cases represent a decision that results are more important than process, that finality is more important than fairness, and that proceeding with executions is more important than determining whether convictions and sentences were obtained fairly and reliably. texas is the leading death penalty state in the usa, accounting for 378 of the 1,054 executions carried out in the usa since judicial killing resumed there in 1977 (36 per cent). texas has routinely violated international standards and safeguards relating to the death penalty, including in its failure to ensure adequate legal representation of indigent capital defendants

scheduled to be executed in virginia on 9 november 2006. he was sentenced to death for the murder of a security guard during a bank robbery in 1999. he is seeking clemency on the grounds that the shooting was accidental and that he was denied a fair trial on the grounds of prosecutorial misconduct. earl shelton dunning was shot and killed at the bon air branch of nationsbank near richmond, virginia, on 17 february 1999. he died as a result of a gunshot wound to his chest. john schmitt was identified as the robber and on 19 february 1999, he was located in a hotel room in williamsburg, virginia. through a police negotiator, schmitt surrendered the next morning. before giving himself up, he admitted to robbing the bank and shooting shelton dunning. he maintained that the robbery had been to obtain money to purchase drugs (he had been addicted to cocaine and heroin for several years). he told the negotiator that he had never intended to kill anyone, and that the gun had gone off accidentally during a struggle with the guard. at the trial, the jury were told that john schmitt had robbed the same bank a month earlier (at which time the bank did not employ a security guard and no one had been injured during the robbery). after john schmitts arrest, but before his murder trial, the police arranged for his friend and former employer, cliff sauer, to secretly tape record any telephone conversations he had with schmitt from the jail. a conversation was recorded in which john schmitt described how he and the security guard had struggled over schmitts gun, and that it had gone off accidentally. he said that he had not intended to kill the guard, and expressed confidence that the banks security video recording would support his version of events. however, not only had none of the witnesses in the bank seen the shooting, but neither had it been captured on the banks surveillance camera. at the guilt/innocence phase of the trial, at which the only issue was whether the murder was premeditated, the judge did not allow either john schmitts statements to the police negotiator or his taped conversation with cliff sauer to be introduced by the defense. the state introduced expert evidence that the gun had been fired at shelton dunning at a distance of 12 to 36 inches. according to the clemency petition, there are two autopsy reports, the first dated 31 march 1999 and an amended version dated 23 june 1999. in the later version, references to soot found on shelton dunnings right sleeve and hand, which would be consistent with the gun having been fired at close range during a struggle, had been deleted. the defense lawyers had access to both autopsy reports, but did not cross-examine the medical examiner about the discrepancies. the jury convicted

convicted john schmitt of premeditated murder. at the sentencing phase, the state introduced evidence of john schmitts prior convictions for drug use, receipt of stolen property, commission of a crime in possession of a firearm, together with evidence of his violations of probation, and victim impact testimony from members of shelton dunnings family. the prosecution also introduced the taped conversation as evidence to support a finding of schmitts future dangerousness, an aggravating factor in virginia that makes a crime punishable by the death penalty. as well as containing schmitts claim that the shooting had been accidental, it also indicated a lack of remorse on schmitts part. studies have shown that a perceived lack of remorse in a defendant is a highly aggravating factor in the minds of us capital jurors. the jury sentenced john schmitt to death. after the case had moved into the federal appeals process, evidence of prosecutorial misconduct in relation to the secretly taped conversation came to light. specifically, the state had suppressed evidence that cliff sauer had received immunity from prosecution in return for his testimony, and that it had provided sauer, who was mentally unstable, with a free mental health evaluation. in proceedings before district judge robert payne, cliff sauer testified that he had cooperated with police and prosecutors because he was afraid that he might otherwise face charges, having brokered a deal for schmitt to buy a car using money stolen from the first bank robbery in january 1999. judge payne found that sauer had been told that the states purpose in having sauer tape conversations with schmitt was to obtain incriminating information about the february 1999 crime. the prosecutor used this evidence although schmitt had at the time of the recording already been assigned a lawyer, and despite neither the lawyer nor schmitt knowing of the secret taping. at the evidentiary hearing before judge payne, the prosecutor acknowledged that the taped evidence of schmitts lack of remorse was critical at the sentencing phase. judge payne himself described it as a ticket to the death chamber. he found that the evidence of sauers relationship to police and prosecutors could have been used to impeach sauers credibility, and had been suppressed, thus violating the us supreme courts 1963 ruling, brady v. maryland. judge payne held that the prosecutor suppressed evidence of obvious impeachment value moreover, when the prosecutor testified at the evidentiary hearing, he seemed to regard the whole concept of brady as a game. nevertheless, judge payne let the conviction and death sentence stand. upholding this ruling in july 2006, the us court of appeals for the fourth circuit said: we emphasize that the intentional suppression of impeachment material and other prosecutorial misconduct should not be taken lightly and we could not agree more with the district courts conclusion that this prosecution team displayed a disconcerting lack of respect for its sole responsibility to ensuupholding this ruling in july 2006, the us court of appeals for the fourth circuit said: we emphasize that the intentional suppression of impeachment material and other prosecutorial misconduct should not be taken lightly and we could not agree more with the district courts conclusion that this prosecution team displayed a disconcerting lack of respect for its sole responsibility to ensure that justice shall be done, as opposed to merely winning the case. the fourth circuit emphasized that the prosecutorial misconduct in the case was not confined to a single incident. under international law, anyone accused of a criminal offence has the right to the presumption of innocence, equality of arms (i.e. with neither party to a case put at a substantial disadvantage to the opposing party), and an effective defense. an essential element of the right to an effective defense, set out in article 14 of the international covenant on civil and political rights (iccpr), requires that the defendant be able ""to examine, or have examined, the witnesses against him"". in order to be able effectively to challenge any such witness, the defendant must be provided with any information known to the prosecution which may tend to impeach the witness credibility or reliability, including his or her relationship with the state authorities. furthermore international standards place a duty on the prosecution to uphold human rights; in particular, the un guidelines on the role of prosecutors require that prosecutors ""perform their duties fairlyand uphold human rights, thus contributing to ensuring due process and the smooth functioning of the criminal justice system"". the prosecutor failed to meet this standard in this case. virginia accounts for 97 of the 1,053 executions in the usa since executions resumed in 1977. amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases. today, 129 countries are abolitionist in law or practice. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: - expressing sympathy for the family and friends of earl shelton dunning, and

there is no un-doing a sentence of death once it is carried out. bobby wilchers lawyer appealed to the us supreme court, presenting the justices with the question of whether the fifth circuit had been right to refuse to reinstate wilchers appeals due to the eleventh hour nature of the filing. half an hour before wilcher was due to be executed on 11 july, the supreme court order that the execution be delayed in order that it could consider the motion, and an hour later granted the stay to allow it to consider whether to take the case and consider the merits of the question raised. on 2 october, the us supreme court dismissed the appeal without comment. two days later, bobby wilcher signed another affidavit reiterating that he wished to take up his appeals. on 5 october, his lawyer filed an emergency motion in the district court seeking reinstatement of the appeals. on 14 october, the judge denied the motion. that ruling is now on appeal to the fifth circuit court of appeals and the case will again go to the us supreme court if the fifth circuit does not provide a remedy. background information over recent years, conditions on mississippis death row have been severely criticized, including in relation to the psychological impact of these conditions and the poor mental health care provided. in may 2003, a federal judge ruled that the conditions in the state penitentiary offended contemporary concepts of decency, human dignity and precepts of civilization which we profess to possess. judge jerry davis found that death row inmates were being subjected to profound isolation, intolerable stench and filth, consistent exposure to human excrement, dangerously high temperatures and humidity, insect infestations, deprivation of basic mental health care, and constant exposure to severely psychotic inmates in adjoining cells. among other things, the federal judge found that: the filthy conditions impacted on the mental health of inmates; the probability of heat-related illness was high for death row inmates, particularly those suffering from mental illness who either did not take appropriate steps to deal with the heat or whose medications interfere with the human bodys temperature regulation; the exposure to the severely psychotic individuals was intolerable; the mental health care provided to inmates was grossly inadequate; and the isolation of death row, combined with the conditions on it and the fact that its population are awaiting execution, would weaken even the strongest individual. in 2004, the us court of appeals agree[d] that the conditions of inadequate mental health care do present a risk of serious harm to the inmates' mental and physical health. again, the obvious and pervasive nature of these conditions supports the conclusion that [mississippi department of correction] officials displayed a deliberate indifference to these conditions. while the authorities have recently improved the environmental conditions on death row following the lawsuit brought against them, there has been an ongoing struggle to ensure adequate medical and mental health care. over the past decade, the un commission on human rights repeatedly adopted resolutions calling for an end to the use of the death penalty against anyone suffering from any form of mental disorder. scores of prisoners with histories of mental illness have been executed in the usa since 1977 (see ai report usa: the execution of mentally ill offenders,",0,"bobby wilcher"

is scheduled for execution in oklahoma on 22 august 2006. he was sentenced to death in 1998 for the murder of his 13-month-old daughter tessa leadford in 1997. on 21 february 1997, james malicoat and his girlfriend brought their 13-month-old daughter to the county hospital emergency room. it was determined that the child had been dead for several hours, and that her death had been caused by a head injury and internal bleeding from abdominal injuries. james malicoat subsequently admitted to police that he had caused the injuries. he said that he had not realized that his actions would seriously hurt or kill his child. he was charged with first-degree murder and brought to trial in 1998. in oklahoma, first-degree murder by child abuse is a general intent crime. as such, the prosecution was not required to prove that james malicoat intended to kill or injure his child, but only that he intended to commit the abusive act. the oklahoma court of criminal appeals (occa) has upheld the constitutionality of this law and ruled that a defendant convicted under it may be sentenced to death. the jury convicted james malicoat and sentenced him to death. in 2000, the occa upheld the sentence despite finding numerous instances of prosecutorial misconduct at the sentencing phase. evidence that james malicoat had failed to pay child support was admitted at the trial. the occa said this was irrelevant and could only serve to prejudice malicoat further in the eyes of the jurors. the prosecutor read out in court a first-hand account of the babys final hours, that is, as if from the childs perspective. the occa described this as theatrical, and conduct that very nearly constitutes an improper solicitation of sympathy for the victim. the prosecutor repeatedly described malicoat as a monster and evil. the occa noted that it had repeatedly looked with disfavor on this sort of name-calling. it described as improper and reprehensible several of the prosecutors arguments for execution. nevertheless, it ruled that this misconduct, even cumulatively, had been harmless to the defendant. over the objection of the defense, the state had introduced a photograph of tessa leadford taken two months before her death. the occa said that photographs of live victims are generally inadmissible, as they are irrelevant to any issues at trial. it held that this photo was irrelevant and should not have been admitted, and that the state's use of it in closing argument compounded the error. arguing for a death sentence, the prosecutor had held up this photo of the live child and compared it with four post-mortem pictures. nevertheless, the appeal court concluded that the use of the photo did not contribute to malicoat's death sentence. in contrast, in a deover the objection of the defense, the state had introduced a photograph of tessa leadford taken two months before her death. the occa said that photographs of live victims are generally inadmissible, as they are irrelevant to any issues at trial. it held that this photo was irrelevant and should not have been admitted, and that the state's use of it in closing argument compounded the error. arguing for a death sentence, the prosecutor had held up this photo of the live child and compared it with four post-mortem pictures. nevertheless, the appeal court concluded that the use of the photo did not contribute to malicoat's death sentence. in contrast, in a decision in texas, also in 2000, the state's court of criminal appeals overturned the death sentence of condemned inmate raymond reese because the jury at his trial had been shown a photograph of the victim lying in a coffin next to her unborn fetus. the court ruled that this may have inflamed jurors into voting for death, saying that it is society's natural inclination... to protect the innocent and the vulnerable. the fact that reese's death sentence was overturned, while malicoat's was not, would appear to be an example of arbitrariness in the application of the death penalty in the usa. james malicoat was himself subjected to severe physical and psychological abuse as a child. according to his clemency petition, by the age of five, james malicoat was being beaten by his mothers husband, and was subjected to abuse for years. his stepfather would hit him with wrenches, pitchfork handles and an electric cattle prod. he would lock the boy in a chicken coop with fighting roosters to teach him not to be afraid of them. the roosters would attack the boy, and his mother has recalled that she could hear him screaming from 100 feet (30 meters) away. jamess mother, who had herself suffered an upbringing marked by sexual, physical and mental abuse, was threatened with death by her husband (including at gunpoint on one occasion) if she were to take the children away. she has said that she used to contact the police at least twice a month about the abuse being inflicted on her son, but eventually stopped because it never did me any good. eventually, when james malicoat was about 14 years old, the stepfather was prosecuted for child abuse and pleaded guilty to feloniously, wilfully, maliciously and intentionally injuring his adoptive son by beating him repeatedly with a wooden board. not long after this, james malicoats mother left her husband and took the children with her. james malicoats mother has recalled how the abuse changed her son, and caused him to become a subdued child but with a short temper  hed get very angry and he would never know exactly why he was getting angry. she has recalled that james began having fainting spells and blackouts (which the jury was not told). he was hospitalized at around the age of 17 as he was having suicidal thoughts. james malicoats trial took place in grady county district court. behind the judge was a large carving of two statues depicting a man and a woman holding a sword between them. along the blade is the inscription an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. in the bible, this phrase appears in exodus, deuteronomy, and leviticus, and includes in those books the notion of life for life; life shall go for life, and he that killeth a man, he shall be put to death. the largest religious denomination in oklahoma is southern baptism (accounting for about a third of the states population), the leadership of which has contended that the

the context of a capital trial i believe that the sign is outrageous and unconstitutional. the oklahoma pardon and parole board has voted to deny clemency to james malicoat, despite appeals for clemency from his family and the mother of tessa leadford. the governor has the power to grant a reprieve. amnesty international urges that he do so and that he ask the board to reconsider the case with a view to recommending clemency and breaking the cycle of violence in this case. oklahoma has the highest rate of execution per capita of all the us death penalty states. it ranks 27th of the 50 us states in terms of population and third in the number of executions carried out since the usa resumed judicial killing in 1977 (behind texas and virginia). it accounts for 81 of the nationwide total of 1,037 executions since that year. oklahoma has violated international law and standards in its pursuit of judicial killing and its prosecutors have earned a reputation for misconduct in capital cases (see usa: old habits die hard: the death penalty in oklahoma, april 2001, http://web.amnesty.org/library/index/engamr510552001 ). in june 2006, the governor of oklahoma signed into state

shot and killed kimbirli barton on 16 january 2003. he then shot himself in the head with his shotgun, but survived. at his trial for the murder, his defense was that the killing had not been premeditated. a jury rejected this and the trial went into its sentencing phase. rocky barton refused to have any mitigating evidence presented to the jury. instead, he made the following statement to the jury: at this time my attorneys have advised me to beg for my life. i cant do that. i strongly believe in the death penalty. and for the ruthless, cold-blooded act that i committed, if i was sitting over there, id hold out for the death penaltylife in prison would be a burden to all the citizens of ohio. it would be at their cost. i wouldnt have nothing to worry about. id get fed every

thats the only punishment for this crime. thats all ive got to say. in its 2006 affirmation of the death sentence on mandatory appeal, the ohio supreme court rejected the argument that the trial judge should have inquired whether rocky barton was mentally competent to waive his right to present any mitigating evidence. it reached this conclusion by deciding that bartons statement to the jury asking for the death penalty was mitigating evidence. two of the justices dissented. justice pfeifer wrote: our countrys most creative writers of fiction would be hard-pressed to spin bartons statement as evidence offered in mitigation. yet a majority of this court unquestioningly accepts that it was. he also wrote: i do not believe that the facts of this case justify imposing a sentence of death. the murder that barton committed was heinous, and his guilt is undeniable, but bartons crime is not deathworthy this case involves a hot-blooded domestic killing. chief justice moyer wrote: it is difficult to imagine more compelling indicia of incompetence than a defendant asking to be executed, and accused the majority of applying inverse logic to interpret the statement as mitigating. he added: i do not know whether barton was competent to waive the presentation of mitigation evidence during the penalty phase of the trial. i do not know whether he understood the ramifications of his statements to the jury suggesting that he deserved the death penalty. on the record before us, no one can be certain of bartons competence when he urged the jury to sentence him to death. in a recent

whether he understood the ramifications of his statements to the jury suggesting that he deserved the death penalty. on the record before us, no one can be certain of bartons competence when he urged the jury to sentence him to death. in a recent interview, in contrast to his assertion to the jury that it was a ruthless, cold-blooded murder, rocky barton recalled that the shooting was done on the spur of the moment, and was not planned, calculated, designed. he said that he had planned to kill himself in front of kimbirli, but had then turned the gun on her: i dont know why i did. cant tell you what was going through my mind at the time. rocky barton is reported to have been diagnosed on death row as suffering from a major depressive illness and schizo-affective disorder, for which he has received medication. on 5 july 2006, a judge found him competent to waive his appeals, despite refusing to allow a psychiatric evaluation to determine competence. background information in 1972, the us supreme court overturned the usas capital laws after finding that the death penalty was being applied in an arbitrary manner (furman v. georgia). four years later, in gregg v. georgia, the court approved new laws passed by state legislatures. executions resumed in january 1977 after almost a decade without them. there have been some 500,000 murders in the usa since 1977. in the same period about 7,000 people have been sentenced to death, just over 1,000 of whom have been executed and about 3,300 of whom remain on death row. the capital justice system, which attempts to select the worst of the worst crimes and offenders for execution, is marked by arbitrariness, discrimination and error. as the un special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions concluded in 1998, race, ethnic origin and economic status appear to be key determinants of who will, and who will not, receive a sentence of death in the usa. in 2000, the findings of a long-term study were released which concluded that us death sentences are persistently and systematically fraught with error that had required judicial remedy from the appeal courts. about one in 10 of the people executed

sentence, including mental disorder, physical illness, remorse, bravado, religious belief, the severity of conditions of confinement, including prolonged isolation and lack of physical contact visits, the bleak alternative of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, pessimism about appeal prospects, a quest for notoriety, or simply a desire to gain a semblance of control over a situation in which the prisoner is otherwise powerless. rational or irrational, a decision taken by someone who is under threat of death at the hands of others cannot be consensual. what is more, it cannot disguise the fact that the state is involved in a premeditated killing  part of a culture of violence, not a solution to it. whether or not prisoners who ask to be executed are deluding

suicide, ''prisoner-assisted homicide'' would be a more accurate label. for if a death row inmate seeks to commit actual suicide, the state will make every effort to prevent it. the phenomenon of prisoners volunteering for execution contributes to the lottery of the death penalty. to put it another way, given the rate of reversible error found in capital cases, if the approximately 120

and that his capacity to appreciate the criminality of his act or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law was substantially impaired. nevertheless, on 25 june 2002, the judge sentenced him to death. just before the sentence was passed, the victims mother reportedly stated that she forgave william downs. william downs childhood was one marked by poverty as well as physical and sexual abuse. his father allegedly subjected the children to severe beatings, including with a fiberglass fishing pole, electric cords, and the handle of a cattle whip. on a least one occasion the children had to be taken for emergency hospital treatment. william downs attempted suicide when he was 10 years old; the first of a number of attempts. william downs has been found competent to waive his appeals. various mental health experts have agreed that he suffers from depression, and have noted his numerous suicide attempts. at a hearing into his competency to waive his appeals, one of the doctors noted that william downs may have suffered a major depressive episode in the past and that he has been unhappy all his life. a forensic psychiatrist testified that she did not have enough evidence to rule out a diagnosis of major depression, and could therefore not offer an opinion on his competency. the judge found that william downs did not have a current desire to commit suicide, but that he preferred execution to imprisonment. the judge ruled him competent to drop his appeals. background information in 1972, the us supreme court overturned the usas capital laws after finding that the death penalty was being applied in an arbitrary manner (furman v. georgia). four years later, in gregg v. georgia, the court approved new laws passed by state legislatures. executions resumed in january 1977 after almost a decade without them. there have been some 500,000 murders in the usa since 1977. in the same period about 7,000 people have been sentenced to death, just over 1,000 of whom have been executed and about 3,300 of whom remain on death row. the capital justice system, which attempts to select the worst of the worst crimes and offenders for execution, is marked by arbitrariness, discrimination and error. as the un special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions concluded in 1998, race, ethnic origin and economic status appear to be key determinants of who will, and who will not, receive a sentence of death in the usa. in 2000, the findings of a long-term study were released which concluded that us death sentences are persistently and systematically fraught with error that had required judicial remedy from the appeal courts. about one in 10 of the people executed since 1977 have been so-called volunteers, prisoners who had dropped their appeals and consented to execution. any number of factors may lead a prisoner not to pursue appeals against his or her death sentence, including mental disorder, physical illness, remorse, bravado, religious belief, the severity of conditions of confinement, including prolonged isolation and lack of physical contact visits, the bleak alternative of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, pessimism about appeal prospects, a quest for notoriety, or simply a desire to gain a semblance of control over a situation in which the prisoner is otherwise powerless. rational or irrational, a decision taken by someone who is under threat of death at the hands of others cannot be consensual. what is more, it cannot disguise the fact that the state is involved in a premeditated killing  part of a culture of violence, not a solution to it. whether or not prisoners who ask to be executed are deluding themselves about the level of control they have gained over their fate  after all, they are merely assisting their government in what it has set out to do anyway  the state is guilty of a far greater deception. it is peddling its own illusion of control: that, by killing a selection of those it convicts of murder, it can offer a constructive contribution to efforts to defeat violent crime. in reality, the state is taking to refined, calculated heights what iwhether or not prisoners who ask to be executed are deluding themselves about the level of control they have gained over their fate  after all, they are merely assisting their government in what it has set out to do anyway  the state is guilty of a far greater deception. it is peddling its own illusion of control: that, by killing a selection of those it convicts of murder, it can offer a constructive contribution to efforts to defeat violent crime. in reality, the state is taking to refined, calculated heights what it seeks to condemn  the deliberate taking of human life. while such executions are sometimes referred to as a form of state-assisted suicide, ''prisoner-assisted homicide'' would be a more accurate label. for if a death row inmate seeks to commit actual suicide, the state will make every effort to prevent it.the phenomenon of prisoners volunteering for execution contributes to the lottery of the death penalty. to put it another way, given the rate of reversible error found in capital cases, if the approximately 120 volunteers executed since 1977 had pursued their appeals, there is a significant possibility that a number of them would have had their death sentences overturned to prison terms by the appeal courts. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: - expressing sympathy for the family of keenan omailia, and explaining that you are not seeking to downplay the seriousness of the crime or the suffering caused;

who has a history of mental illness, is scheduled to be executed in tennessee on 28 june. he was sentenced to death in 1999 for the 1997 murder of two young women. he has given up appeals against his conviction and death sentence. angela holmes, who was 21, was kidnapped together with 16-year-old michelle mace, at a baskin-robbins ice-cream shop in the town of clarksville on the night of 23 april 1997. their bodies were found the following day. both had been stabbed. at paul reids trial in september 1999, the jury convicted him of the murders. at the sentencing, the state presented the jury with victim impact testimony from family members of the murder victims, graphic descriptions and photographs of the knife wounds sustained by the two women, and evidence of the defendants prior convictions for murder (paul reid had already been sentenced to death for two other murders at a fast food restaurant in nashville in 1997, and in 2000 would be sentenced to death for three other murders that took place at a nashville mcdonalds in 1997). the defence presented expert mental health and medical testimony. a clinical psychologist testified that paul reid suffered from serious mental illness, including chronic schizophrenia, and had brain damage. a clinical neuropsychologist explained that reid had suffered a number of serious head injuries as a result of childhood abuse and accidents. a neurologist explained that brain scans had revealed several abnormalities in reids brain, including evidence of traumatic injury. the defence experts related how paul reid had long suffered from delusional beliefs, including that he was under government surveillance and control. the state presented a forensic psychiatrist who testified that in his opinion paul reid was malingering, although he conceded that reid had brain damage and a history of mental illness, including delusions. however, he testified that he could identify no link between these mental health issues and the crime. in closing arguments for a death sentence, the prosecutor placed the crime scene photographs of the murder victims on a projector and argued that paul reids mental illness had not been behind the crime, but his greed, using dollar bills to illustrate his point. the jury sentenced paul reid to death on 22 september 1999. in may 2005, the tennessee supreme court affirmed the conviction and sentences, rejecting the claims raised in his automatic direct appeal. since then, paul reid has dropped his appeals. his sister is appealing to the courts to grant her next friend status, and to have a lawyer appointed to his case, on the grounds that her brother is mentally incompetent to waive his appeals and to act on his own behalf. in an affidavit to the courts in support of her efforts to stop the execution, paul reids sister has said that her brother is severely mentally ill. he does not think or act in a rational manner. it seems that everything he does is guided by his belief in a government conspiracy against him to bombard him with scientific technology. when he has talked about giving up appeals and being executed, he talks about ending the torture of the scientific technology. additional affidavits from others involved in the case further describe reids mental problems. a neuropsychiatrist, for example, has stated that mr reids delusion, that he has been under the control of a government-directed surveillance and influence, impels, invades, and guides his daily activities as well as decision-making processes. mr reids delusional beliefs substantially preclude him from making a rational choice among his legal options. the lawyer who was assigned the case before paul reid dropped his appeals also signed an affidavit in may 2006 stating that reids mental illness substantially affects his capacity to make knowing, intelligent, and voluntary decisions about his legal situation. i have known paul reid for over twenty months and during that entire time, his delusional beliefs have been persistent and have pervaded his thinking about all aspects of his life. his delusional beliefs have caused him to either refuse to discuss legal issues with me, as he believes it is futile, or to discuss only the specific delusional beliefs he holds about his trial attorneys, the trial judges, the jurors, witnesses, courtroom personnel, state and federal appellate courts, the media, the governor, the president, congress, department of correction personnel  literally everyone. background information at least 119 of the 1,024 men and women executed in the usa since judicial killing resumed in 1977 went to their deaths after dropping their appeals. many of these so-called volunteers had histories of mental illness. a condemned prisoner who drops his appeals has to be competent to do so, but the protections in such cases have proved minimal. if a condemned inmate is found incompetent to waive his or her appeals, someone found to have legal standing as a next friend may pursue litigation on their behalf. in 2002, in atkins v. virginia , the supreme court prohibited the death penalty for people with mental retardation. the court reasoned that the impairments of defendants with mental retardation diminish their personal culpability and their ability to understand consequences, rendering the death penalty unjustifiable on grounds of retribution or deterrence. amnesty international believes that there is a profound inconsistency in exempting people with mental retardation from the death penalty while those with serious mental illness remain exposed to it. the same rationale of diminished culpability, greater vulnerability and limited capacity applies to defendants afflicted with severe mental illness. tennessee has

in 1990 it ruled, in another death penalty case, that north carolinas jury unanimity requirement was unconstitutional. following these rulings, brown tried to raise the issue in appeals in his case, but was unsuccessful. since then, other prisoners on death row in north carolina have reportedly had their death sentences reversed after appeals based on these supreme court rulings. according to his present attorneys, brown is the only prisoner under sentence of death in north carolina to face execution despite the fact that his jury received instructions that were later found unconstitutional, and the fourth circuit court of appeals has concluded that the states refusal to hear browns claim was unjust compared to these other cases. background information there is strong support for a moratorium on executions in north carolina because of concerns about the fairness and reliability of the death penalty. almost 1,100 resolutions calling for a moratorium have been passed by town councils, private businesses, church congregations and religious organizations, political parties and student and community groups. many north carolina newspapers have carried editorials in favour of a moratorium on executions. attempts are underway by the north carolina coalition for a moratorium (which includes amnesty international) to encourage legislators to pass a moratorium bill during the legislative session beginning in may. the house of representatives select committee on capital punishment, which is currently undertaking a legislative study of the death penalty, has met three times since the last legislative session ended in october 2005, and are preparing their report and recommendations. the committees report will be used by the coalition in the months ahead to propose further death penalty reforms that will narrow the application of the death penalty and move legislators towards a moratorium. since 1977, when the usa resumed judicial killing, the us supreme court has provided some constitutional protections for mentally impaired people facing the death penalty. in 1986, in ford v. wainwright , the court ruled that the execution of people who are insane violates the us constitutions prohibition on ""cruel and unusual punishments"". a decision by the supreme court in 2002 ( atkins v. virginia ) prohibited the death penalty for people with mental retardation, reasoning that mental retardation diminishes personal culpability, and renders the death penalty difficult to justify on deterrence and retribution grounds. on march 1 2005, citing the overwhelming weight of international opinpinion and evolving standards of decency the supreme court, in roper v. simmons , finally outlawed the death penalty for offenders who were under the age of 18 at the time of their crime. the roper majority quoted the atkins decision: capital punishment must be limited to those offenders who commit a narrow category of the most serious crimes and whose extreme culpability makes them the most deserving of execution. today, 122 countries are abolitionist in law or practice, and there are strict international safeguards applying to those countries which have not yet abolished the death penalty. for example, the united nations safeguards guaranteeing protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty prohibit the execution of ""persons who have become insane"". the un commission on human rights has repeatedly called on those countries which still retain the death penalty not to use it against anyone suffering from a mental disorder. amnesty international does not seek to excuse the perpetrators of violent crime. however, it opposes the death penalty in all cases. amnesty international believes that there is a profound inconsistency in exempting people with mental retardation from the death penalty while those with serious mental illness remain exposed to it. similarly, exempting juvenile offenders from the death penalty because of their diminished culpability is incongruous with executing those suffering from serious mental illness or impairment other than retardation. for further information on mentally ill offenders under sentence of death in the usa see ais recent report: usa: the execution of mentally ill offenders (amr 51/003/2006, january 2006). recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: - expressing sympathy for the family and friends of vallerie anne roberson dixon, explaining that you are not seeking to condone the manner of her death or to minimize the suffering caused;

(court record, 12 may 2005.) moodys current attorneys have presented a clemency petition to governor easley which includes the above concerns as well as concerns that moody received ineffective legal representation from his trial attorney, who they say, among other things, failed to properly investigate mitigating evidence for his trial. on 2 july 2004, indiana governor joseph kernan commuted the death sentence of darnell williams, whose iq was measured at a similar level to moodys, shortly before he was due to be executed (see ua 207/04, amr 51/104/2004, 24 june 2004). governor kernan noted the 2002 us supreme court decision, on 2 july 2004, indiana governor joseph kernan commuted the death sentence of darnell williams, whose iq was measured at a similar level to moodys, shortly before he was due to be executed (see ua 207/04, amr 51/104/2004, 24 june 2004). governor kernan noted the 2002 us supreme court decision, atkins v virginia , outlawing the use of the death penalty for those who have mental retardation. the governor wrote: williamss iq has been measured at 78 and 81, and he attended special education classes throughout his schooling. the usual cut-off for mental retardation is iq of 70-75, and williams falls above that level the courts have set a clear legal standard, but it remains problematic to confidently place the solemn decision of life or death on a few percentage points on either side of a line. williamss mental status weighs as a factor in the clemency process. background information there is strong support for a moratorium on executions in north carolina because of concerns about the fairness and reliability of the death penalty. almost 1,100 resolutions calling for a moratorium have been passed by town councils, private businesses, church congregations and religious organizations, political parties and student and community groups. many north carolina newspapers have carried editorials in favour of a moratorium on executions since 1977, when the usa resumed judicial killing, the us supreme court has provided some constitutional protections for mentally impaired people facing the death penalty. in 1986, in ford v. wainwright , the court ruled that the execution of people who are insane violates the us constitutions prohibition on cruel and unusual punishments. a decision by the supreme court in 2002 ( atkins v. virginia ) prohibited the death penalty for people with mental retardation, reasoning that mental retardation diminishes personal culpability, and renders the death penalty difficult to justify on deterrence and retribution grounds. on march 1 2005, citing the overwhelming weight of international opinion and evolving standards of decency the supreme court, in roper v. simmons , finally outlawed the death penalty for offenders who were under the age of 18 at the time of their crime. the roper majority quoted the atkins",0,"patrick moody"

the week beginning 5 december 2005, for the 1991 murder of a white woman, jane frances tyson. jane tyson was shot in the head at point-blank range on 6 june 1991, as she was getting into her car at a shopping mall. a passer-by pursued a vehicle with two occupants which sped from the scene, noted its registration number and called the police. driver gregory baker and passenger wesley baker were arrested after a chase. in maryland, only the actual murderer can be sentenced to death. wesley baker was charged as the gunman. he was sentenced to death on 30 october 1992. gregory lawrence was sentenced to life imprisonment. doubts have been raised about whether wesley baker was the actual gunman. the victim's six-year-old grandson, who was present at the attack, indicated that the man who shot his grandmother ran to the driver's side of the getaway vehicle. the man who pursued the vehicle identified wesley baker as being on the passenger side. blood from jane tyson was found on baker, but lawrence's clothing was not tested. there were fingerprints from baker's right hand on tyson's car. however, as the us court of appeals for the fourth circuit noted in 2000, ''one must wonder how it was possible for [the right-handed baker] to hold the gun to tyson's head and leave his fingerprints on the [car], especially in light of the fact that the incident took only a matter of moments.'' it emerged after baker's trial that gregory lawrence had a history of armed robberies, including a carjacking in which he had held a gun to the victim's head. in denying bakers appeal in july 2000, the fourth circuit court of appeals admitted that ''the evidence that baker shot tyson was not overwhelming''. the united nations safeguards guaranteeing protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty state that ''capital punishment may only be imposed when the guilt of the person charged is based upon clear and convincing evidence leaving no room for an alternative explanation of the facts.'' wesley baker was the subject of two previous uas: ua 98/01 (amr 51/059/2001, 12 april 2001) and extra 33/02 (amr51/065/2002, 29 april 2002). background information in recent years marylands capital justice system has drawn scrutiny and concern. in 1996 the then governor, parris glendening, appointed a task force on the fair imposition of capital punishment to look into the fairness of the states death penalty system. the task force concluded that in maryland ''the high percentage of african-american prisoners under sentence of death and the low percentage of prisoners under sentence of death whose victims were african-american remains a cause for concern''. following this, governor glendening commissioned a study by the university of maryland into the states capital justice system. the study's report was released in january 2003. entitled an empirical analysis of maryland's death sentencing system with respect to the influence of race and legal jurisdiction , by professor raymond paternoster of the university of maryland, the study examined all first and second-degree murders committed in maryland from september 1978 until december 1999, approximately 6,000 cases in all. this is the most comprehensive study of the impact of race and geography on the death penalty in maryland. governor glendening also imposed a moratorium on executions in may 2002, just days before wesley baker was due to be executed, pending the outcome of the study. the university of marylands study concluded that, even when other factors are taken into account, people who kill white victims are ""significantly"" more likely to face the death penalty than killers of non-whites. it also concluded that prosecutors in different counties within the state ""exhibit considerable variation"" in their pursuit of the death penalty. in terms of whether a particular ""death-eligible"" murder will be pursued as a capital crime, therefore, ""clearly the jurisdiction where the homicide occurs matters and matters a great deal"". wesley baker was prosecuted by baltimore county, which was named as one of the us counties with the highest death sentencing rates in a major study of the us death penalty by columbia law school in 2002, as well as the highest error rates in capital cases. baltimore county accounts for three of the four people executed in maryland since 1978, when the current death penalty statute became effective. upon taking office in 2003, governor robert ehrlich lifted the moratorium in the state, saying that he would review every death warrant on a case-by-case basis. amnesty international does not seek to excuse the perpetrators of violent crime. however, it believes the death penalty is wrong in all cases, this is a punishment that is an affront to human dignity and a part of a culture of violence rather than a solution to it. it has not been shown to deter crime more effectively than other punishments; it denies the possibility of rehabilitation and reconciliation, carries the risk of irreversible error as well as inconsistent and discriminatory application, and consumes resources that could be used to fight violent crime and

execution of wesley baker; - noting that there are still doubts about whether he was the gunman; - noting the university of maryland study which concluded that there is racial and geographic bias in

- opposing the execution of kenneth boyd; - noting reports of kenneth boyd's low iq level, his sincere remorse and the fact that he has been a model prisoner; - noting that he is a vietnam veteran who suffered from flashbacks following his experiences in vietnam and who was reportedly suffering from severe depression and alcohol abuse at the time of the crime; - stating that while you recognize that this cannot excuse the crime for which he was sentenced to death, it should be taken into consideration when determining the granting of clemency; - noting reports that two of the original jurors who imposed the death sentence have since stated that they would not have voted for a sentence of death if they had been aware that a sentence of life imprisonment was an option;

she did not commit the murder. frances newtons attorneys have filed a motion for a stay of execution. they claim that evidence used to convict her, which could potentially prove her innocence, was destroyed by the state; that at her trial, prosecutors improperly withheld information; and that she had ineffective legal assistance during her trial from a lawyer who failed to investigate fully her claims of innocence. she had been due to be executed on 1 december 2004, but was granted a 120-day reprieve by texas governor rick perry, to allow time for the retesting of the physical evidence used to convict her (see ua 313/04, amr 51/163/2004, 19 november 2004, and follow-up). on 7 april 1987, a police officer responding to a report of a possible shooting in a houston apartment complex found 21-year-old frances newton in her apartment with her cousin, sondra nelms. also in the apartment were the bodies of frances newtons husband, adrian newton, her seven-year-old son, alton, and 21-month-old daughter, farrah. all three victims had been shot. at the trial, sondra nelms testified that on the night of the shootings frances newton had placed a bag in another house shortly before the two of them went to the newtons' apartment where they found the bodies. the bag was later found to contain a gun, and testimony at the trial indicated that it was the murder weapon. an expert testified that the lower front part of frances newtons skirt contained nitrites, consistent with a gun having been fired close to it. however, forensic experts testified that the nitrites found on frances newtons skirt could have come from fertilizer. during the day of the murder, farrah newton had stayed with her uncle while her mother was at work. the uncle had a large garden, which could account for the transfer of fertilizer particles to the lower front side of frances newtons skirt. one of the jurors subsequently stated that, had it been determined that the nitrites on the skirt came from fertilizer, she would have found it important in her deliberations as a fact supporting newtons innocence. the juror's statement was included in the successful motion for a stay of frances newtons execution in december 2004. the reprieve granted in december 2004 was designed to allow sufficient time for the retesting of her skirt and of the gun thought to be the murder weapon. however, when frances newtons current attorneys petitioned the courts to allow retesting of her skirt earlier this year, the request was denied because the states initial tests had destroyed the nitrite evidence on the skirt, and the skirt had also become cross-contaminated after it was stored with the victims clothing. retesting of the gun found it to be the murder weapon. however, in their latest appeal, frances newton's lawyers claim that trial prosecutors withheld information relating to the discovery of a second gun at the crime scene which may have been the murder weapon. frances newton was prosecuted in harris county, where the city of houston is located. in march 2003, an independent audit of the houston police department (hpd) crime laboratory revealed serious defects in the labs dna analysis section, including poorly trained staff relying on outdated scientific techniques. several cases suggest that the laboratorys problems extended beyond its dna section, for example into its ballistics expertise. on 21 october 2004, a judge on the texas court of criminal appeals said that there should be a moratorium on all executions in cases where convictions were based on evidence from the hpd crime lab until the reliability of the evidence has been verified. a texas senator and the houston police chief have made similar calls. an independent investigation of the laboratory is in progress. testimony of the states trial witnesses, taken together, suggests that either frances newton was not in the apartment at the time of the shooting, or that if she was she would have had, at most, 20 minutes to shoot her husband and children, clean herself up, compose herself, and leave the apartment to go to her cousins home. there was no blood found on frances newtons clothing, hands, or car, despite the fact that the victims had been shot at close range. no gunpowder residue was found on her hands or sweater. there was also no evidence that someone had cleaned up the apartment. amnesty international opposes all executions, regardless of issues of guilt or innocence. one of the most compelling arguments against the use of the death penalty is the risk that innocent people may be executed. the united nations safeguards guaranteeing protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty prohibit the execution of anyone whose guilt is not based on  clear and convincing evidence leaving no room for an alternative explanation of the facts. serious miscarriages of justice in capital cases have already occurred in the usa. since 1973, 121 people have been

typically, such individuals are increasingly dependent upon those around them and act in a more subservient and differential role. rather than planning and initiating activities, these individuals follow the lead of the more dominant individuals in the group. two men, stanley hall and rance burton, were involved in the murder of barbara wood. at gunpoint, barbara wood was forced into the passenger side of her car, and driven to a bridge over the mississippi river. barbara wood was forced out of the car and a struggle ensued during which she was wounded. according to the trial record, rance burton fled the scene and stanley hall pushed barbara wood off the bridge and into the river, where she died. rance burton was allegedly the driving force behind the abduction, and there is evidence that he shot barbara wood prior to her being thrown in the river. rance burton was not charged in the crime for which stanley hall is now facing execution. prior to the trial, the st louis county prosecutor agreed to offer stanley hall a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole in return for a guilty plea. the conditions on this agreement were that hall would give a full statement, take a polygraph test on this account of the crime, and testify against rance burton. the results of his initial polygraph test were inconclusive. he subsequently took another test, which he passed. however, the prosecutor withdrew from the agreement and the case went to trial with the state seeking the death penalty. stanley hall is african american. barbara wood was white. halls clemency petition raises evidence of the possible impact of race on his case. in st louis county, in the year that he was prosecuted, four black defendants accused of crimes involving white victims offered to plead guilty and accept a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. the prosecutor rejected all four offers. in three cases involving black victims and black defendants, such pleas were accepted. between january 1991 and march 1996, all st louis county defendants sent to death row were convicted of crimes involving white victims. yet during this period, more than half of murder victims in the county were black. stanley halls jury had no african americans on it, after the prosecution peremptorily removed the last two remaining african americans from the jury pool during the selection process. studies in the usa have consistently shown that murders involving white victims are more likely to result in a death sentence, and this can be particularly pronounced when the defendant is black. at the sentencing phase of the trial, arguing for the execution of stanley hall, the prosecutor related a story to the jurors of how, when he was a child, he had had his dog put down: when i was a young boy, i had a puppy and his name was beauregard. he was about this long. beauregard came from an animal shelter and he was a wonderful animal. he would follow you everywhere. he would stay on a little leash. he would come and he would wag his tail when you got home, pant and jump on you, and i found out beauregard had distemper and the veterinarian said the right thing to do is have him put to sleep. and as a young child, i was  it was a tremendous decision. but there was only one right thing to do. you are faced with a tremendous decision but there is only one right thing to do and that man (stanley hall), this crime deserves the death penalty. the missouri supreme court called the prosecutor ;s argument a shameless ploy. the us court of appeals for the eighth circuit called his remarks irrelevant, unnecessary, and improper. nevertheless, they have upheld the death sentence. stanley hall is said to be remorseful and to be a productive prisoner, who as worked on a program with at-risk youth brought into the prison in attempts to turn them away from crime. amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases. in the usa, the capital justice system is marked by arbitrariness, discrimination and error. the usa has carried out 954 executions since 1977. missouri accounts for 61 of these executions. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible, in your own words: - expressing sympathy for the family and friends of barbara wood, explaining that you are not seeking to condone the manner of her death or to minimize the suffering caused; - expressing concern at evidence that stanley hall has mental retardation, which would render his execution unconstitutional and against missouri law; - expressing concern that of the two men involved in this crime, one was not charged and the other is facing execution, the most extreme possible disparity, and not reflective of their relative culpability in the case;

a world full of miracles in every direction, a treasure-house for anyone who stops and looks. somehow i got caught up into an ever-escalating cycle of emotional reaction that blinded me to everything not part of my own projections. and i try to remember who that angry and confused kid was, try to recall what he was thinking...but he is alien to me now  almost incomprehensible. so i wrote all of that to preface an answer to your question about death row culture. it's difficult to answer because it isn't static at all, but is constantly evolving. when i first came to death row, there were only 12 of us there. the death penalty had only recently been restored, so no one was close to death unless they volunteered like steven judy (executed in 1981) had, and like a few others would later... most of us, certainly i, were in a state of arrested development. i mean by this that we'd had lives of trouble and reaction that stopped us from integrating either within ourselves or within society as a whole. during his time on death row donald wallace has studied greek, latin and arabic, as well as religion and philosophy. he is reported to have read the bible and the koran from cover to cover numerous times, and says that he has read more than 4,000 other books. donald wallace is not currently seeking clemency from governor mitch daniels, the new governor of indiana, who was inaugurated on 10 january 2005. background information amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases, regardless of question of guilt or innocence, the seriousness of the crime, or the method the state chooses to kill the condemned prisoner. this is a punishment that is an affront to human dignity and a part of a culture of violence rather than a solution to it. it has not be shown to have a unique deterrent effect, denies the possibility of rehabilitation and reconciliation, carries the risk of irreversible error as well as inconsistent and discriminatory application, and consumes resources that could be used to fight violent crime and assist those affected by it. lethal injection is promoted in the usa as a humane method of execution. there can be no such thing  forcing someone to live for years under a death sentence is cruel both to the condemned person and to their family. in any event, there is evidence that the drugs used in lethal injections may serve to mask the pain and suffering of the condemned prisoner. today, 118 countries are abolitionist in law or practice. in this context, the usas claims to be a progressive force for human rights ring hollow. it has carried out 949 executions since 1977. indiana accounts for 11 of these executions, the most recent being that of joseph trueblood in june 2003. on 7 january 2005, as one of his last acts in office, outgoing indiana governor joe kernan commuted the death sentence of michael daniels, citing the prisoners mental illness and doubts whether he was the gunman in the killing of a minister, allan streett, in 1978. allan streetts son, who witnessed the killing of his father when he was 15 years old, supported the commutation. he reportedly said that he did not believe that the death penalty serves as a deterrent, and he described the 25 years that michael daniels had spent on death row as cruel and inhumane. governor-elect mitch daniels made no comment at the time of the commutation of michael danielss death sentence. however, in statements earlier this month, governor daniels acknowledged that he has moral reservations about the death penalty. he said that there are honest moral questions about whether the death penalty is an appropriate punishment. however, he added that the people of indiana very clearly believe that at least in the worst of cases the option of this penalty is appropriate, and i agree. on 4 february, in a meeting with journalists, he said that there were two issues involved: first of all, theres the need to make sure in any case that theres not one particle of doubt about guilt and then secondly, very honestly, to weigh the questions of to whom justice and vengeance ultimately belongs. governor daniels has spoken openly of his religious faith (he is an elder at tabernacle presbyterian church in indianapolis). recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: - explaining that you are not seeking to excuse the crime for which donald wallace was sentenced to death or to minimize the suffering caused; - explaining your opposition to the death penalty, and noting the governor ;s statements that he has moral reservations about this punishment; - calling on the governor to stop the execution of donald wallace and to lead his state away from this outdated and brutalizing penalty. appeals to: governor mitch daniels office of the governor indianapolis, indiana 46204-2797",0,"donald wallace"

that he had displayed a sincere, genuine and strong expression of remorse for the crime (in a meeting with a parole board member, william smith had tearfully stated that he takes full responsibility for his inexcusable, unjustifiable and inexplicable behaviour); that, at the time of the crime, he had suffered from a personality disorder that may have manifested in a loss of impulse control; and that he has  demonstrated exemplary conduct and adjustment in prison. nevertheless, the board decided that the seriousness of the crime outweighed these mitigating circumstances. the boards recommendation is not binding on the governor. background information amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases, regardless of question of guilt or innocence, the seriousness of the crime, or the method the state chooses to kill the condemned prisoner. this is a punishment that is an affront to human dignity and a part of a culture of violence rather than a solution to it. it has not be shown to have a unique deterrent effect, denies the possibility of rehabilitation and reconciliation, carries the risk of irreversible error as well as inconsistent and discriminatory application, and consumes resources that could be used to fight violent crime and assist those affected by it. today, 118 countries are abolitionist in law or practice. in this context, the usas claims to be a progressive force for human rights ring hollow. it has carried out 949 executions since 1977. ohio accounts for 15 of these executions. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: - expressing sympathy for the family and friends of mary bradford, explaining that you are not seeking to excuse the manner of her death or to minimize the suffering caused;

murder occurred in the early hours of 8 october 1992 following a party at which timothy carr and others consumed large amounts of alcohol, marijuana and hallucinogenic mushrooms. timothy carr, melissa burgeson, keith young, and two 16-year-olds, left the party in the victim's car. keith young's body was found the next day. the two teenagers were tried in juvenile court in 1992 on murder and theft charges. one was found guilty on all counts, and sentenced to 18 months in juvenile detention. the other was convicted on the theft charge only and was ordered to receive counseling. of the two adults, melissa burgeson was tried first. timothy carr was advised by his lawyer to give a full confession to the monroe county prosecutor and to testify at burgeson's trial. the lawyer said he had obtained a verbal assurance from the prosecutor that if carr "" helped"" him, he would ""help"" carr. the lawyer said that he understood this to mean that carr would receive an offer of life imprisonment in return for a guilty plea. at burgeson's trial in 1994, at which the prosecutor sought a death sentence, carr testified that he was very intoxicated at the time of the murder and had been compelled by burgeson to stab young. the prosecutor urged the jury to believe carr's testimony, and described burgeson as the least intoxicated of the suspects, and the ""moving force"" behind the crime, also arguing that melissa burgeson had herself stabbed the victim. the prosecutor referred to timothy carr as burgeson's ""puppet"". the jury found burgeson guilty of murder, and sentenced her to life imprisonment. in 1999, an investigator from monroe county sheriff's department stated that ""as far as keith young's death, i think [burgeson] played just as much a part in it as anybody...i think she instigated it, planned it and everything"". he agreed with the prosecutor's characterization of carr as burgeson's "" puppet"". timothy carr was tried two months after his co-defendant, and repeated his testimony from her trial. this time the prosecutor described carr as the prime mover in the crime. he urged the jury to discredit carr's ""feeble"" defense and to disbelieve his account of having been intoxicated by alcohol and drugs and being influenced by burgeson. having argued at melissa burgeson ;s trial that she had stabbed the victim, the prosecutor argued at timothy carrs trial that burgeson had not inflicted a single cut on keith young. the jury, without knowing about burgeson's life sentence and her reported history of violence and intimidation, including against carr, sentenced timothy carr to death. in june 2000, a state court judge overturned carr's death sentence. the court had found that his trial lawyer had ""committed serious errors which prejudiced the defense"", including his failure to present ""a significant amount of mitigating information about [carr's] life history and the circumstances of the crime"", including ""details of [carr's] extremely difficult childhood, evidence of physical and sexual abuse suffered by [carr] at the hands of his father, the history of alcoholism and mental illness in his family, evidence of a brain injury suffered at [carr's] birth, as well as good character evidence"". having heard such evidence since the trial, one of the jurors has stated that it ""would have been powerful evidence that mr carr was not the bad, irredeemable person the prosecutor wanted us to see."" she continued: ""having finally heard about the story of tim carr's life, i dearly wish that this information had been presented at trial. it would have made a big difference. if i had had the information summarized here before me at the trial, i would have voted for a life sentence."" a georgia jury must be unanimous before it can pass a death sentence. nevertheless, in march 2001 the georgia supreme court reinstated timothy carr's death sentence. on the mitigating evidence issue, the georgia supreme court ruled that the jury had heard enough to make their sentencing verdict reliable. in july 2002, timothy carr received a stay of execution after the us court of appeals for the 11th circuit agreed to consider his case (extra 53/02 issued 12 july 2002 and re-issued 19 july 2002). the court rejected the appeal in march 2004 and in december the us supreme court declined to take the case. international safeguards require adequate legal representation for capital defendants ""at all stages of proceedings"", above and beyond that provided in non-capital cases. in 1996, the un special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions emphasized that in capital cases ""all mitigating factors must be taken into account"". the un guidelines on the role of prosecutors require prosecutors to ""at all times maintain the honor and integrity of their profession"", and to "" perform their duties fairly, consistently and expeditiously,...thus contributing to ensuring due process and the smooth functioning of the criminal justice system"". the monroe county prosecutor contravened such principles in his effort to achieve at least one death sentence. amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases. today, 118 countries are abolitionist in law or practice. the usa has carried out 945 executions since resuming judicial killing in 1977. georgia accounts for 36 of these executions. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible, in your own words: - expressing sympathy for the family and friends of keith patrick

beardslee is scheduled to be executed in california on 19 january 2005.he was sentenced to death in 1984 for the murder in 1981 of paula geddling. a recent examination has revealed that he suffers from severe brain damage, which the jurors who sentenced him to death did not know. paula geddling and stacy benjamin were killed on 24 april 1981. according to the evidence presented at trial, william forrester had given stacy benjamin money for drugs, but she had not delivered them. forrester, paula geddling ;s estranged husband ed geddling, ricarda soria and frank rutherford planned to lure stacy benjamin to donald beardslees apartment and force her to return the money. donald beardslee was not involved in the initial planning and had only known the others for a few weeks. stacy benjamin arrived at the apartment together with paula geddling, whom frank rutherford then shot in the shoulder. geddling was subsequently put in a van and told she was being taken to hospital. however, she was instead shot, first by william forrester and then by donald beardslee. the evidence as to who fired the fatal shot was inconclusive. beardslee, rutherford and soria then drove off with stacy benjamin, and she was killed. paula geddlings body was discovered on 25 april 1981, and donald beardslees phone number was found in her pocket. the following day he provided the police with a detailed account and led them to stacy benjamin ;s body. he was charged with both murders on 3 may 1981. he was convicted by a jury on 18 october 1983. on 23 january 1984, he was sentenced to death by a second jury for the murder of paula geddling and to life in prison for the murder of stacy benjamin. the jury evidently struggled with its decision, deliberating for almost 23 hours over four days. donald beardslees clemency lawyers have revealed evidence of his mental impairment. an expert recently conducted an assessment of beardslee and concluded that he suffers from severe brain damage, and that the right hemisphere of his brain is virtually non-functioning. the expert has concluded that in all likelihood he has suffered from this impairment since birth and it was exacerbated by serious head injuries he sustained when a teenager and in his early 20s. the expert has stated: the profound, likely lifelong damage to the right hemisphere of mr. beardslees brain made him unable to correctly process and contextualize information. the impairment produced confusion and then paranoia under most unfamiliar circumstances, particularly those that involved social interaction with a number of different individuals these deficits and resultant behaviours were observed by ricarda soria at the time of the crimes as the confusion and emotional tension increased, mr. beardslee was described as becoming strangel y silent, and moving aimlessly from room to room, in a subdued and automatic fashion. later, his actions were described as frankly unconscious. the expert said that the severity of donald beardslees mental impairment would likely have left jurors interpreting his flat demeanour as indicating a callous individual. studies have shown that a perceived lack of remorse in a defendant is a highly aggravating factor in the minds of capital jurors. the prosecutor repeatedly depicted beardslee as a remorseless killer, and told the jury that they could evaluate him from his demeanour in the courtroom. the jury was not presented with the evidence of brain damage, allowing the prosecutor to argue that the defendant was not suffering from any mental disorder. in repeated resolutions in recent years, the united nations commission on human rights has called for an end to the execution of people with any form of mental disorder. donald beardslee's lawyers have raised serious questions about his culpability, compared to the others involved in the crime, because of his mental impairment, his relative lack of involvement in the planning of the crime, and his cooperation with the police. after his arrest, he had told the police that he was on parole for a second-degree murder conviction in missouri. the prosecutor later used this conviction for the 1970 murder extensively in arguing for death. yet there are serious questions around the reliability of that conviction, including an illegal police interrogation of beardslee. in 1991, two california supreme court judges argued that donald beardslees death sentence should be overturned because of the erroneous admission of this evidence, which was tainted by egregious police conduct and which could have tipped the jury towards a death sentence. the two judges were in the minority, however, and the death sentence was upheld. at the trial, the jury sought information about the sentences imposed on donald beardslees co-defendants. however, the request was denied. the co-defendants had been tried first. ricarda soria pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and received a 15-year to life prison sentence. william forrester was acquitted. frank rutherford was convicted of the first-degree murder of stacy benjamin and is serving life imprisonment. ed geddling was not charged. one of the two dissenting supreme court judges mentioned above wrote: defendant, rutherford, forrester, soria, and ed geddling were all engaged in the common criminal enterprise that culminated in the two murders. nevertheless, only defendant was condemned to death. i recognize that  intracase disproportionality may be found only if the capital punishment system has operated in an arbitrary and capricious manner. plainly, the system operated in such a manner here put simply, it is altogether irrational to take the life of defendant in punishment for the killings and to spare the lives of all the others. at the trial, the prosecutor argued that donald beardslee was an extremely dangerous and merciless individual. he is, in short, a cold-blooded killer without compassion who may kill again for the slightest provocation. the death penalty will certainly deter him from ever killing again. the prosecutor stressed that donald beardslee would be dangerous even in prison. donald beardslee has proved the prosecutor wrong. he has had an exemplary disciplinary record in prison, without a single rules violation. he is said to present no danger to the staff or inmates, to have worked diligently and competently for various correctional officers, and contributed to the overall safety of prison staff. amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases. today, 118 countries are abolitionist in law or practice. the usa has carried out 945 executions since 1977, including 59 in 2004 and one in 2005. california has carried out 10 executions since 1977, the last one in january

condone the manner of their deaths, or to minimize the suffering caused; - expressing concern that the jurors who sentenced donald beardslee to death for the murder of paula geddling were unaware of his serious mental impairment, noting that even without this evidence they struggled to reach a verdict; - expressing concern at the evidence of disproportionality of sentencing in this case; - noting

now i will have to live with this for the rest of my life. maybe this man was innocent. prior to his 1992 trial, cameron willingham had turned down a life prison sentence in return for a guilty plea because he said he was innocent. at the trial, the state presented evidence that he had confessed to another jail inmate that he had set the fire, and evidence that he had not tried hard enough to rescue his children. among the states scientific evidence of arson was that of crazed glass in the house. this was presented as an indicator that the fire had become especially hot as a result of an accelerant being applied. however, it has since been shown that crazed glass can be created as a result of hot glass being sprayed with water when the fire is being put out. the four experts called other aspects of the investigation into question. on 6 october 2004, ernest ray willis was released after 17 years on death row in texas. he was sentenced to death in 1987 for the 1986 murder of two women who died in a house fire that was ruled to have been arson. after a court granted willis a new trial in 2004, the county prosecutor hired an arson specialist to review the original evidence. the expert, one of those now saying that the willingham arson evidence is unsafe, concluded that there was no evidence of arson, and that the accelerant"" initially suspected of causing the fire was in fact ""flashover burning,"" consistent with electrical fault fires. the prosecutor dropped all charges, saying that willis ""simply did not do the crime i'm sorry this man was on death row for so long and that there were so many lost years."" texas accounts for 336 of the 944 executions carried out in the usa since 1977. amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases, regardless of guilt or innocence. since 1973, 117 people have been released from us death rows after evidence of their innocence emerged. others have gone to their deaths despite serious doubts about their guilt. further recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible, in your own words, including willinghams former prisoner number #999041 in your appeals: - expressing deep regret at the execution of cameron willingham on 17 february 2004; - noting new evidence that cameron willingham was convicted on the basis of a seriously flawed fire investigation, and that four arson experts have concluded that the house fire could have been accidental; - noting the case of ernest willis, and that cameron willingham had consistently maintained his innocence, including in his final statement before being killed by the state; - calling for a full independent inquiry into this case, and for the results to be made public; - calling on the addressees to support a moratorium on executions in texas. appeals to: governor rick perry, office of the governor, po box 12428, austin, texas 78711-2428",0,"cameron willingham"

some in three days or three hours. to those who say three weeks is insufficient time in which to thoughtfully debate this topic, i say the legislature has already had more than two decades. and they have chosen not to repeal the law. however, if the legislature does wish to take up this issue as they convene next month, i encourage them to do so, for the death penalty is an issue that evokes the strongest of positions and emotions. it is an issue that gives rise to true conflicts of conscience, and as the scheduled execution date of michael ross grows near, the profound gravity that surrounds the actual imposition of the death penalty becomes all too real and all too pointed. i do not believe that there are sufficient votes in the general assembly to repeal the death penalty. i believe a majority of legislators wish to see this ultimate punishment remain the law. but if the legislature does act, it must do so overwhelmingly for i will veto any repeal bill. i do believe there are crimes and actions which are so repugnant to society as to warrant the death penalty. and this is such a case in the end, we are all judged by our deeds, not our words. michael ross has already been judged for his despicable deeds. now it is time for him to face his punishment. amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases, regardless of the gravity of the crime, the guilt or innocence of the condemned, or the method used to kill the prisoner. the death penalty has not been shown to have a unique deterrent effect, it denies the possibility of remorse, rehabilitation or reconciliation, and it consumes resources that could otherwise be used towards constructive strategies to combat violent crime and to offer assistance to those affected by it. executions cannot guarantee emotional peace for the relatives of murder victims, risk brutalizing society, and undermine respect for fundamental human rights. however heinous the crime, and even if the prisoner has dropped his or her appeals, there is no disguising the fact that the state is involved in a premeditated killing, a policy that is a symptom of a culture of violence rather than a solution to it. the state is taking to refined, calculated heights what it seeks to condemn b the deliberate taking of human life. further recommended action: please continue to send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible, making your own arguments or those contained in the original action: - expressing sympathy for the families of the murder victims in this case, and explaining that you are not seeking in any way to excuse the manner of their deaths or to minimize the suffering caused;

injection in connecticut in the early hours of 26 january 2005. he has dropped his appeals against his death sentence. the state of connecticut has not carried out an execution for almost 45 years. michael ross was sentenced to death in 1987 for the murder of four teenagers, all female, in 1983 and 1984: robin stavinsky, 19; wandy baribeault, 17; leslie shelley, 14; and april brunais, 14. he is also serving life sentences for the murder of tammy williams, 17, and debra smith taylor, 23, and up to 25 years for the murder of 16-year-old paula perrera. he admitted to killing another woman, dzung ngoc tu, 25, in 1981, but has not been prosecuted in that case. most of the victims were raped. michael rosss death sentence was overturned by the state supreme court in 1994 because the jury had not been able to consider evidence that the murders were the result of sexual sadism, a psychiatric disorder. at a re-sentencing in 2000, the jury rejected the sexual sadism claim as a mitigating factor and he was once again sentenced to death. in connecticut, the board of pardons has the authority to grant clemency. as the prisoner is not filing a clemency petition, only two people can stop the execution: michael ross himself, who could change his mind and pursue his appeals, or the governor, who can grant a temporary reprieve. under article 4, section 15 of connecticuts constitution, the governor shall have power to grant reprieves after conviction, in all cases except those of impeachment, until the end of the next session of the general assembly, and no longer. such a reprieve in michael rosss case, which governor m. jodi rell has said she will consider, would allow the connecticut legislature to discuss the future of the death penalty, including abolition, in its forthcoming 2005 session without having already taken the backward step of resuming executions. michael ross has written to governor rell urging her to let his execution proceed. in his letter, he claims that he is seeking to bring an end to the pain that the appeals process causes to the murder victims families. he also maintains that there will not be an honest debate on the death penalty by the state legislature until after he has been put to death. he wrote that while he is on death row any such debate would instead ""degrade into a referendum of whether michael ross should live or die"". background information the last time a prisoner was executed in connecticut was on 17 may 1960, when joseph taborsky was put to death in the states electric chair. in 1960, nine countries had abolished the death penalty for all crimes. today, 81 countries are abolitionist for all crimes, and a total of 118 are abolitionist in law or practice. while the usa has bucked this abolitionist trend, with 944 executions carried out since judicial killing resumed in the usa in 1977, the rate of death sentencing and executions has nevertheless slowed over the past five years as national concern about the death penalty has grown. at least 110 of the people executed in the usa since 1977, including 10 of the 59 put to death this year, were so-called volunteers, prisoners who had dropped their appeals and consented to execution. the first execution carried out in the usa after the us supreme court ruled in 1976 that judicial killings could resume was that of gary gilmore, who had dropped his appeals. his was the first execution in utah since 1960 and the first in the usa since 1967. since then 12 other states  delaware, idaho, illinois, indiana, maryland, nevada, new mexico, ohio, oregon, and pennsylvania  have resumed judicial killings with a consensual execution. in 2001, the us government carried out the first federal execution since 1963: that of timothy mcveigh, who had dropped his appeals. perhaps these  volunteers have made it easier for us society to stomach state-sanctioned killing. as amnesty international illustrated in an april 2001 report (ai index: amr 51/053/2001, http://web.amnesty.org/library/index/engamr510532001 ) any number of factors may lead a prisoner not to pursue appeals against his or her death sentence, including mental disorder, physical illness, remorse, bravado, religious belief, the severity of conditions of confinement, including prolonged isolation and lack of physical contact visits, the bleak alternative of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, pessimism about appeal prospects, a quest for notoriety, or simply a desire to gain a semblance of control over a situation in which the prisoner is otherwise powerless. rational or irrational, a decision taken by someone who is under threat of death at the hands of others cannot be consensual. what is more, it cannot disguise the fact that the state is involved in a premeditated killing, a policy that is a symptom of a culture of violence rather than a solution to it. whether or not a prisoner who asks to be executed is deluding himself or herself about the level of control they have gained over their fate b after all, they are merely assisting their government in what it has set out to do anyway b the state is guilty of a far greater deception. it is peddling its own illusion of control: that, by killing a selection of those it convicts of murder, it can offer a constructive contribution to efforts to defeat violent crime. in reality, the state is taking to refined, calculated heights what it seeks to condemn b the deliberate taking of human life. such executions could be perhaps be characterized as prisoner-assisted homicide rather than  state-assisted suicide. amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases, regardless of the gravity of the crime, the guilt or innocence of the condemned, or the method used to kill the prisoner. the death penalty has not been shown to have a unique deterrent effect, risks brutalizing society and undermining respect for fundamental human rights, and consumes resources that could otherwise be used towards constructive strategies to combat violent crime and to offer assistance to its victims and their families. history shows that countries have not waited for public opinion to turn against the death penalty before abolishing it. principled human rights leadership is required for such a step. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible, using any of the above information or your own arguments, using the following as a guide: - expressing sympathy for the families of the murder victims in this case, and explaining that you are not seeking in any way to excuse the manner of their deaths or to minimize the suffering caused; - welcoming the fact that the state of connecticut has not carried out an execution since 1960, during which time more than a hundred countries have abolished the death penalty in law or practice; - noting that recent years have seen growing national concern in the usa about the death penalty; - urging the governor to do all in her power to see that connecticut does not take the backward step of resuming executions, but instead offers an example of leadership on this fundamental issue; - urging the governor to use her constitutional power to issue a reprieve so that the legislature has the option of abolishing the death penalty before the state countenances resumption of executions.

uan@aiusa.org www.amnestyusa.org/urgent/ ua 322/04       death penalty / legal concern       24 november 2004 usa (north carolina)    charles anthony walker (m), black, aged 39 charles walker is scheduled to be executed in north carolina on 3 december 2004. he was convicted in 1995 of the first degree murder of tito davidson in 1992. charles walker, who has a history of mental illness, was convicted on the basis of testimony of accomplices, none of whom was subjected to a capital trial. the jury which sentenced him to death did so despite finding that he had not actually killed tito davidson, whose body was never found. several of the jurors now support clemency. tito davidson went missing on 11 august 1992, and is believed to have been murdered the next day at pamela haizlips apartment in the town of greensboro. on 13 august, police received an anonymous tip that there was a body in a rubbish bin at the apartment block, but none was found. a month s search through 10,000 tons of landfill refuse that included the contents of such bins collected between 11 and 17 august 1992 also revealed no dead body. after antonio wrenn, a suspect in an unrelated case, told police about some firearms that he claimed had been used in an unsolved murder in which the body had been thrown into a rubbish bin, the police began building a case based on statements of the alleged participants in tito davidsons suspected murder. rahshar darden, pamela haizlip, jesse thompson, charles walker and antonio wrenn were arrested and charged with first degree murder. rahshar darden pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and was released in 2001 after serving six years in prison. jesse thompson accepted a second-degree murder plea and is now eligible for parole. antonio wrenn pleaded guilty to being an accessory to murder and served seven years in prison. pamela haizlip made a similar plea and was sentenced to time already served (two years). the state offered charles walker a second-degree murder plea, but he refused it, maintaining his innocence and firing his lawyer who had urged him to accept the plea. the lawyer has said that he puts this reaction down to charles walkers mental problems. after walker rejected the plea bargain, the case then automatically proceeded as a capital case, which would not have happened under todays state law. the state presented no physical evidence of any kind that linked charles walker to the murder: no fingerprints, no blood evidence, no autopsy, no dna evidence, and no ballistics evidence. indeed, there was no physical evidence of a murder, and no confession from the defendant. all the evidence against walker came from the inconsistent testimony of witnesses who were themselves implicated in some way in the crime. rahshar darden, the only person who claimed to have seen tito davidson killed, testified that he and jesse thompson had repeatedly shot davidson and slashed his throat. he claimed that davidson was still alive when charles walker came in and killed him with a single shot. however, other testimony, provided by antonio wrenns girlfriend, indicated that darden and thompson had said after the murder that darden had shot davidson four times in the chest and once between the eyes, and that thompson had fired the last, fatal shot into davidsons chest. pamela haizlip also testified that thompson had admitted to her that he and darden had killed davidson. the jurors clearly found it difficult to reach a verdict, taking two days to find walker guilty. at the sentencing, the jury was not provided with a full picture of the man they were being urged to pass a death sentence against. the jury heard some evidence that he suffered from mental illness, bipolar disorder with paranoid features. this was consistent with the diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia that he had received as a child, a mental illness which after his initial hospitalizations had remained untreated from the age of 12 when he lived on the streets of new york. the jurors were not presented with the records documenting this childhood mental illness, however. in 1982, aged 17, living in an abandoned building, he shot a man who he thought was following him with malicious intent. he was sent to prison with a recommendation of psychiatric treatment. he was released after six years without receiving the treatment. eighteen months later his parole was revoked and he was sent back to prison for another year, before being paroled again in august 1991. he has spent all but about two years of his adult life in prison. he has been prescribed anti-psychotic and other medication on death row. the jury did not hear substantial available evidence of charles walkers early childhood abuse at the hands of his parents or their history of mental illness. his cousin has since recalled the physical abuse to which charles was subjected as a young boy by his mother, including being whipped in the face with a belt, whippings with electrical cords, and being burned with a steam iron. his mother was addicted to cocaine, and he was exposed to her drug usage from an early age. at the age of five, he witnessed her being stabbed almost to death by one of her boyfriends in their home. the jury deliberated for four days before recommending a death sentence. on their sentencing form, the jurors answered no to the question of whether charles walker had fired the fatal shot. instead they found that he had intended to kill the victim while acting with others. several of the jurors have recently said that they believe that the death sentence should be commuted to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, an option that was not available to them at the time of the trial. background information amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases. the death penalty is an affront to human dignity and a symptom of a culture of violence. in addition, the capital justice system in the usa is marked by arbitrariness, discrimination and error. since 1973, 117 people have been released from us death rows after evidence of their innocence emerged. others have gone to their deaths despite serious doubts about their guilt. there have been 944 executions in the usa since it resumed judicial killing in 1977, 34 of them in north carolina. the united nations safeguards guaranteeing protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty prohibits the execution of anyone whose conviction is not based upon clear and convincing evidence leaving no room for an alternative explanation of the facts. in repeated resolutions in recent years, the un commission on human rights has called on all states that still have the death penalty not to use it against anyone suffering from a mental disorder. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible, in your own words: - expressing sympathy for the family and friends of tito davidson; - opposing the execution of charles walker, and expressing concern about the reliability of his conviction, noting that the case against him was based on the inconsistent testimony of witnesses implicated in the case, a notoriously unreliable form of evidence; - noting charles walkers history of untreated mental illness and his background of childhood abuse, substantial details of which the jurors did not hear; - noting that several jurors have now said that they support commutation of the death sentence; - calling on governor easley to commute charles walkers death sentence. appeals to:

the judge questioned them about this conversation, and they denied that they had already reached a verdict. the judge found that the contents of the conversation between the juror and her baby-sitter could not be ascertained, and refused to declare a mistrial or to dismiss the juror in question. the appeal courts have not allowed a full hearing on this issue. according to sammy perkinss clemency lawyers, the trial jurors were not presented with the full picture of the man they sentenced to death. several of his family suffered from bipolar disorder (manic depressive illness), and he had begun showing signs of this serious mental illness from his late teens. being from a poor family he was unable to get appropriate treatment, and used cocaine, heroin and alcohol to alleviate his symptoms. he was also on prescription drugs for myasthenia gravis, a disease that causes muscle weakness. although his trial lawyers presented evidence of this disease, they had not investigated his bipolar condition, and the jury did not hear expert evidence about this illness and its effects on the defendant. sammy perkinss current lawyers are challenging the lethal injection process in north carolina, on the grounds that it violates the constitutional prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. the lethal injection process involves three chemicals: sodium thiopental (a short-acting anaesthetic), pancuronium bromide (which paralyzes the muscles, but does not affect the brain or nerves) and potassium chloride, which causes death by cardiac arrest. a person injected with pancuronium bromide alone remains conscious but cannot move or speak. legal challenges have been made against its use in executions in various states on the grounds that if the anaesthetic fails, the pancuronium bromide may throw a chemical veil over the reality of lethal injections by masking the suffering caused by the potassium chloride. in a challenge in tennessee, a woman testified that she had undergone surgery during which the anaesthetic had failed. she testified that she was able to hear, perceive and feel everything that went on during her surgery, but was unable to move or speak because of an injection of pancuronium bromide. she has described the experience as worse than death. the use of pancuronium bromide for pet euthanasia is not acceptable under american veterinary medical association guidelines, and its use for this purpose has been banned in several states. background information amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases, regardless of the gravity of the crime, the guilt or innocence of the condemned, or the method used to kill the prisoner. the death penalty is an affront to human dignity and a symptom of a culture of violence, and consumes resources that could otherwise be used towards constructive strategies to combat violent crime and to offer assistance to its victims and their families. in addition, the capital justice system in the usa is marked by arbitrariness, discrimination and error. the united nations safeguards guaranteeing protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty require that capital defendants receive adequate legal assistance at all stages of the proceedings. the un special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions has said that in capital cases, all mitigating evidence must be taken into account. in repeated resolutions in recent years, the un commission on human rights has called on all states that still have the death penalty not to use it against anyone suffering from a mental disorder. today, a clear majority of countries have abolished the death penalty in law or practice. in contrast to this, there have been 929 executions in the usa since it resumed judicial killing in 1977. there have been 44 executions this year. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible, in your own words: - expressing sympathy for the family of jojo moore, and explaining that you are not seeking to excuse the manner of her death or to minimize the suffering it has caused;

preliminary hearings are due to be held in the cases of four men in custody in the us naval base in guantnamo bay, cuba. they have been charged under the military order on the detention, treatment and trial of certain non-citizens in the war against terrorism signed by president bush in november 2001. those held under the order can be tried by military commission, whose verdicts cannot be appealed in any court. the four men who have been charged are ali hamza ahmed sulayman al bahlul, ibrahim ahmed mahmoud al qosi, david hicks, and salim ahmed hamdan. their charges include conspiracy to commit terrorism. the preliminary hearings for the four defendants will take place in a specially built courtroom in guantnamo, before the presiding officer only. it is expected that the presiding officer  retired military judge, colonel peter e. brownback  will hear pre-trial motions, may set trial dates, and will be questioned by defence and prosecution lawyers on his fitness to serve on the military commissions. an amnesty international delegate will observe these preliminary hearings. the death penalty will not be sought against these four defendants. a death penalty trial must be held before seven commission members, and these men will be tried in front of a panel of five military officers, including the presiding officer. life imprisonment will be the maximum punishment available. sentencing is at the discretion of the commission members. there are no detailed guidelines. amnesty international is concerned that any guilty pleas or detainee testimony before the commissions could be the result of the coercive nature of the conditions in which the detainees have long been held without any legal process. the four men, as well as feroz abbasi and moazzam begg who have been made eligible for trial by military commission, but who have not yet been charged, have been held for months in isolation in camp echo, the part of the guantnamo facility where pre-commission detainees are held. their conditions of detention have raised serious concern about their well-being and their susceptibility to making coerced statements. salim ahmed hamdan, for example, is reported to have said that he has considered making a false confession in order to improve his situation. the military commissions will be able to admit coerced evidence. the procedures for the commissions provide that evidence shall be admitted if the presiding officer or a majority of the commission members consider that it would have probative value to a reasonable person. in other words, if a statement made under torture or coerced by the conditions of detention at guantnamo or elsewhere is considered to have some significant evidential value, it shall be admitted. in similar vein, a memorandum from the us justice department to the department of defense, dated 26 february 2002, advised that incriminating statements may be admitted in proceedings before military commissions even if the interrogating officers do not abide by the requirements of miranda [the us supreme court decision controlling the rights of criminal suspects and conduct of interrogators]. it is now known that the administration has approved interrogation techniques that have gone beyond normal us army doctrine. the purpose of the techniques has been to extract information. methodsapproved in december 2002 by secretary rumsfeld for use at guantnamo, for example, included stress positions, sensory deprivation, hooding, stripping, the use of dogs to inspire fear, and isolation. on 7 july 2004, the pentagon announced that another nine foreign detainees had been determined by president bush to fall under the provisions of his military order. these detainees have not been identified. it is not known if they are held in guantnamo bay. they have not yet been charged. amnesty international has called for the military order to be rescinded ever since it was signed, on the grounds that it is fundamentally flawed and because trials under its provisions will violate international fair trial standards. the military commissions will entirely lack independence from the executive, will place severe restrictions on the defence, and provide no right of appeal to any court. the fact that only foreign nationals are eligible for such trials violates the prohibition on the discriminatory application of fair trial rights.

jefferson, in the state of louisiana, is intending to seek a death sentence against lawrence jacobs, or to use the threat of the death penalty to coerce him into accepting a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. lawrence jacobs was 16 years old when he arrested and charged with first degree murder. international law, recognized by almost every government in the world, prohibits the use of the death penalty or life imprisonment without the possibility of release against those who were under 18 at the time of the crime. nelson beaugh, aged 45, and his 75-year-old mother, della beaugh, were shot dead at nelson beaughs home on 31 october 1996. lawrence jacobs and roy bridgewater, who was 17 at the time of the crime, were both convicted of first degree murder and received death sentences. lawrence jacobss conviction and death sentence were overturned by the louisiana supreme court in 2001 on the grounds that he had been denied his right to an impartial jury by the inclusion of jurors who displayed a strong predisposition to imposing death sentences. the court did not address the constitutionality of executing 16-year old offenders, the lack of any direct evidence indicating that lawrence jacobs fired any shot (he maintains that he left the scene before the shootings), or the apparent racial discrimination in the selection of the jury. on the latter question it did note, however, that the prosecutors alleged racial discrimination in the selection of jurors... also appears to raise serious questions regarding the propriety of the jury selection process in the case. the prosecution had dismissed four of the five african-american jurors in the jury pool by using peremptory strikes (the right to reject jurors without giving a reason). the prosecution had also tried to dismiss the fifth african-american juror, but had been prevented from doing so by the trial judge. lawrence jacobs is black (as is roy bridgewater). both the murder victims were white. the state is seeking to retry lawrence jacobs. the prosecution has insisted that if he does not accept a plea bargain under which he pleads guilty and is sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, they will seek the death penalty again. pre-trial hearings will be held in july 2004 on the legality of executing someone who was 16 years old at the time of the crime. prior to his arrest for the crime of which he is now accused, lawrence jacobs was held at the tallulah correctional center for youth (tccy), a privately operated juvenile justice facility later closed as a result of an investigation by the civil rights division of the us department of justice. the investigation found systemic life-threatening staff abuse and juvenile-on-juvenile violence in each of the facilities. other  graduates of tccy have faced capital trials (see p 58-59, usa: indecent and internationally illegal: the death penalty against child offenders, amr 51/143/2002, september 2002). background information: the use of the death penalty against child offenders, people who were under 18 at the time of the crime, is prohibited under international law. the geneva conventions, the international covenant on civil and political rights, the convention on the rights of the child (ratified by 192 countries), the american convention on human rights and the united nations safeguards guaranteeing protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty, all have provisions exempting this age group from execution. since 1990, amnesty international has documented 36 executions of child offenders in eight countries  the democratic republic of congo, iran, nigeria, pakistan, saudi arabia, the usa, china and yemen. the usa carried out 19 of the executions, more than all other countries combined. in its october 2004 term, the us supreme court will revisit its 1989 decision allowing the execution of offenders who were 16 or 17 at the time of the crime. its decision is expected in early 2005. of the 38 death penalty states, louisiana has the highest percentage of african americans on its death row. in april 2004, 67 per cent of its condemned population was black. the state's population at large is 32.5 per cent black and 64 per cent white. eighty-five per cent of the inmates executed in louisiana since 1977 (23 out of 27) were put to death for the murder of white victims. they included child offender dalton prejean, executed in 1990 for the murder of a white police officer. prejean was sentenced by an all-white jury, as were at least six of the other 12 african americans put to death in the state since 1977. every child offender executed in louisiana since slavery is reported to have been black and tried in front of an all-white jury for a crime involving a white victim. ryan matthews, black, was originally sentenced to death in jefferson parish by a jury of 11 whites and one black for the murder of a white man when matthews was 17. on 18 june 2004 he was released on bail pending retrial after four separate dna tests supported his innocence claim. in a pre-trial hearing in lawrence jacobs case in 2002, one of the prosecutors wore a tie which bore the image of an executioner's noose, an image which carried echoes from jefferson parish's history of racist lynching. see usa: death by discrimination  the continuing role of race in capital cases, amr 51/046/2003, april 2003. there are around 70 child offenders on death row in the usa. the number serving sentences of life without the possibility of parole is unknown but far higher. defendants who were as young as 12 years old at the time of the crime have been sentenced to this penalty. according to information received by amnesty international there are more than 300 prisoners serving sentences of life without parole in louisiana for crimes committed when they were 15, 16 or 17. three quarters of them are black. lawrence jacobs case was

karl hicks (m), white, aged 47 robert hicks is scheduled to be executed in georgia on 30 june 2004. he was convicted on 16 january 1986 of the murder of a 28-year-old woman, toni strickland rivers, on 13 july 1985. the jury found three aggravating factors, including the fact that the murder was committed by a person with a prior conviction for rape, and hicks was sentenced to death the next day. because robert hicks could not afford his own lawyer, the trial court appointed one  an attorney who had no experience in murder cases. after several weeks, he had to ask for co-counsel and the judge appointed a lawyer who had tried a capital case. in september 1985, a court-ordered mental examination had been conducted by a state psychologist who found hicks competent to stand trial. given that the identity of hicks as the person who stabbed toni rivers to death was not disputed, it was apparent that the only viable defences and mitigating factors would be based on hickss mental state. in february 1985, the us supreme court had handed down a decision, ake v. oklahoma , in which it ruled that the denial of expert psychiatric assistance to an indigent defendant where that defendants sanity was a significant factor at both the guilt and sentencing phases of the trial constituted a denial of due process. hickss co-counsel, who knew about the ake decision (unlike the lead lawyer) filed a motion requesting an independent psychiatric expert for the defence. the judge authorized $500 for an independent evaluation. the defence attempted to find someone who could do an evaluation for that sum, but were unable to retain anyone for less than $1525. rather than authorizing additional funds, the trial judge responded that he would inquire whether a doctor at the state hospital could perform the evaluation. the psychologist who had performed the initial examination of hicks for the court explained that having another doctor employed by the state to evaluate hicks for the defence would create a conflict of interest. nevertheless, the trial judge insisted that he would find an expert for the defence. the judge decided upon a psychiatrist at the state hospital to conduct the evaluation. on 16 december, less than a month before the trial was due to begin, the hospital informed the defence lawyers that its staff did not  do ake cases. the trial judge nevertheless insisted that he wanted a state-paid psychiatrist in order to save money. the state psychiatrist he had chosen continued to make it clear that he would not do an ake evaluation. on 30 december 1985, the judge relented and authorized the defence lawyers to find a mental health expert subject to his approval of any expenditure and fees. the defence lawyers were unable to locate, gain court approval for, and retain an expert until 9 january 1986. this psychiatrist, dr andrea bradford, met with hicks on 10 january, three days before the trial was due to begin. on 11 january, the psychiatrist informed the lawyers that she would not be able to reach an authoritative diagnosis without the assistance of a neurologist. she made a preliminary diagnosis of neurological damage and a mental disorder called intermittent explosive disorder. one of the defence lawyers later explained that they had had no idea how to formulate [a mental health] defense, or whether we even could honorably formulate one until dr bradford had come back with her diagnosis. they asked for the trial to be postponed so that they could arrange for a neurological examination. the judge refused. the trial proceeded. on the stand, dr bradford admitted that what she had found did not amount to a defence under georgias insanity law. the defences closing argument to the jury was desperate: we are asking you and begging you and imploring you that you deliberate, that you concentrate and that you then vote for a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity. the jury took less than an hour and a half to reject their plea. during appeal proceedings, new lawyers had hicks examined by a neurologist, dr jonathan pincus, who concluded that there is no question that robbie hicks is neurologically impaired. he recommended further tests, but further funding was denied by the appeal court. dr bradford signed an affidavit in which she stated: the preliminary evaluation performed by dr pincus is precisely the type of preliminary neurological examination that i believed was needed in order to begin the process of determining whether [hicks] was suffering from an organic brain impairment or some neurological dysfunction at the time of the crime. in september 2000, a federal district court found that hickss right to expert assistance at trial under ake v oklahoma had been violated by the trial courts prolonged delay in appointing a defence psychiatrist and by the denial of a postponement of the trial to allow more time for the defence to prepare. however, the federal court found that this constitutional violation was harmless. in june 2003, the us court of appeals for the 11th circuit affirmed the district courts decision. amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases. every death sentence is an affront to human dignity, every execution a symptom of a culture of violence. today, 117 countries are abolitionist in law or practice. in the usa, where the capital justice system is marked by arbitrariness, discrimination and error, 915 people have been put to death since executions resumed in 1977. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as

(m), sudan national the six men named above remain in solitary confinement in us military custody in guantnamo bay, cuba. they are the only detainees so far made subject to the military order on the detention, treatment and trial of certain non-citizens in the war against terrorism signed by president bush in november 2001. those held under the order can be detained indefinitely without charge or trial. they can also be tried by military commissions, whose verdicts, including death sentences, cannot be appealed in any court. three of them, ali hamza ahmed sulayman al bahlul, ibrahim ahmed mahmoud al qosi and david hicks, have been charged with conspiracy to commit war crimes. no dates for their trials have been set, but reportedly david hicks may face a military commission in august. all six men are believed to be held in camp echo, the part of the guant namo facility where pre-commission detainees are held. each man is held for 23-24 hours a day in a reportedly windowless cell with no possibility of communication with other detainees. prolonged isolation in conditions of reduced sensory stimulation can cause severe physical and psychological damage. in a declaration signed on 31 march 2004, psychiatrist dr daryl matthews, who visited guantnamo in 2003 at the invitation of the pentagon, stated that the solitary confinement places the detainees at significant risk for future psychiatric deterioration, possibly including the development of irreversible psychiatric symptoms. the announcement that these six detainees were subject to the military order came on 3 july 2003, and they were transferred to camp echo after this. salim ahmed hamdan, who has been in us custody since november 2001, was transferred to camp echo in early december 2003, while feroz abbasi and moazzam begg are believed to have been held there longer. in a separate development, ali hamza ahmed sulayman al bahluls military lawyer said on 22 june that he has not met with his client for two months because of delays obtaining security clearance for an interpreter. amnesty international is concerned that any guilty pleas or detainee testimony before the military commissions could be the result of the coercive nature of the conditions in which the detainees have long been held without any legal process. the conditions in camp echo are likely to leave the detainees there even more susceptible to psychological coercion and false confession. according to dr matthewss declaration, salim ahmed hamdan has said that he has considered confessing falsely to ameliorate his situation. also a legal petition filed in a us federal court on behalf of salim hamdans military lawyer claims that the authorities have told the prisoner that he shall remain in custody until such time as he wishes to plead guilty to some unspecified crime against the united states in a manner satisfactory to [the authorities], and that his appointed defense counsel is not authorized to mount any legal defense to either his detention or the circumstances of his incarceration, but rather is available only to assist mr hamdan in pleading guilty to some unspecified offense. the military commissions, designed to secure convictions on lower standards of evidence, will have the power to admit coerced evidence. a february 2002 memorandum from the justice department to the pentagon, made public on 22 june 2004, states that incriminating statements may be admitted in proceedings before military commissions even if the interrogating officers do not abide by the requirements of miranda [the us supreme court decision controlling the rights of suspects and conduct of interrogators]. the memorandum describes the military commissions as entirely creatures of the presidents authority as commander in chief and are part and parcel of the conduct of a military campaign . other administration memoranda from 2002 and 2003, inter alia , approved interrogation techniques for use at guantnamo that go beyond normal us army doctrine (for example, hooding, isolation, 20-hour interrogations), and discussed how us agents might avoid criminal liability if accused of torture. in addition to the torture committed by us agents in iraq, there have been widespread allegations of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment of detainees elsewhere in the war on terror. two former guantnamo detainees from the uk wrote to a us senate committee in may recalling: after three months in solitary confinement under harsh conditions and repeated interrogations, we finally agreed to confess [to being present at a meeting with osama bin laden]. last september an agent from mi5 [british secret service] came to guantnamo with documentary evidence that proved we could not have been in afghanistan at the time... in the end we could prove our alibis, but we worry about people from countries where records are not as available. amnesty international believes that the military order should be revoked, and that any trial before the commissions, which are executive bodies, not independent courts, would contravene international fair trial standards. the usa should abandon these proposed trials and only countenance proceedings that meet international standards, without recourse to the death penalty. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible, in

maryland in the week beginning 14 june 2004. he was sentenced to death in 1991 for the rape and murder of 20-year-old dawn marie garvin in 1987. if steven oken is executed, he would be the first person to be put to death in maryland since a moratorium on executions announced by the previous governor, parris glendening, on 9 may 2002. he imposed the moratorium pending the outcome of a university of maryland study that he had commissioned in 2000 to look into the fairness of the states death penalty, particularly geographic and racial disparities in capital sentencing. upon taking office in january 2003, governor robert ehrlich lifted the moratorium, stating that he would review every death warrant on a case-by-case basis. on 7 january 2003, the final report of the study was released. an empirical analysis of maryland's death sentencing system with respect to the influence of race and legal jurisdiction , by professor raymond paternoster of the university of maryland, examined all first and second-degree murders committed in maryland from august 1978 (the time when the new capital punishment law took effect) until september of 1999, approximately 6,000 cases in all. this is the most comprehensive study of the impact of race and geography on the death penalty in maryland. it concluded that, even when other factors are accounted for, people who kill white victims are significantly more likely to face the death penalty than killers of non-whites. it also concluded that prosecutors in different counties exhibit considerable variation in their pursuit of the death penalty. in terms of whether a particular death-eligible murder will be pursued as a capital crime, therefore, clearly the jurisdiction where the homicide occurs matters and matters a great deal. murders in baltimore county are more likely to be pursued as death penalty cases than other counties. baltimore county accounts for two of the three people executed in maryland since 1977 and five out of the eight men currently on death row. steven oken was prosecuted in baltimore county. dawn marie garvin was white. marylands death penalty continues to draw scrutiny and the state has been unable to move forward with legislative remedies addressing the acute concerns raised by the university of maryland study. in the last three and a half years the number of death row inmates in maryland has shrunk from 18 to eight without a single execution. the decline is attributable to appellate decisions granting prisoners new trials, dna evidence, or new sentencing because of legal flaws in the initial proceedings. during the 2004 legislative session, legislation to establish the maryland commission on capital punishment passed the maryland senate (30-16), but ultimately failed in a house committee. background information amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases. every death sentence is an affront to human dignity, every execution a symptom of a culture of violence, rather than a solution to it. today, 117 countries are abolitionist in law or practice. in contrast, the usa has already executed 24 people this year, bringing to 909 the number of people it has put to death since executions resumed in 1977. maryland accounts for three of the 909 executions. there are eight people on death row in maryland, seven blacks and one white. all were convicted of killing white people. studies of the us death penalty have consistently shown that race, particularly race of victim, plays a role in who is sentenced to death. in 1994, a us supreme court justice said:  even under the most sophisticated death penalty statutes, race continues to play a major role in determining who shall live and who shall die. the un special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions wrote following his visit to the usa in 1997: ""race, ethnic origin and economic status appear to be key determinants in who will, and who will not, receive a sentence of death"". in its report on the usa in 2001, the un committee on the elimination of racial discrimination noted the ""disturbing correlation between race, both of the victim and the defendant, and the imposition of the death penalty..."" the committee urged the authorities ""to ensure, possibly by imposing a moratorium, that no death penalty is imposed as a result of racial bias on the part of prosecutors, judges, juries and lawyers or as a result of the economically, socially and educationally disadvantaged position of the convicted persons."" steven oken was previously the subject of

now goes to governor brad henry, who can accept or reject it. he can also issue a temporary reprieve. osvaldo torres is scheduled to be executed on 18 may 2004 for a double murder committed in 1993. he was sentenced to death in 1996. at the clemency hearing, the mexican ambassador to the usa appealed for the death sentence not to be carried out. osvaldo torres was denied his consular rights under the vienna convention on consular relations (vccr). under article 36 of the vccr, the authorities must notify all detained foreign nationals without delay of their right to have their consulate informed of their detention. osvaldo torress case featured in a 31 march 2004 judgment by the international court of justice (icj), in a case brought by mexico on behalf of its nationals on us death rows, that the usa had violated its vccr obligations and that it must provide effective judicial review and reconsideration of the impact of the violations in the cases of the foreign nationals involved. at the time of his arrest, osvaldo torres was an 18-year-old without a lawyer who had had minimal contact with the us criminal justice system. he was registered with the immigration authorities as a resident alien, which would have become known to the police when they conducted a routine background check on him upon his arrest. despite this, the authorities never informed him of his rights under the vccr. mexico only learned of the case in 1996 when his family contacted the mexican consulate for help. by then, osvaldo torres had already been convicted and sentenced to death. timely assistance from the mexican consulate could have prevented the imposition of the death penalty, either by persuading the prosecutor not to seek a death sentence or by assisting the defence at the trial. the crime in question was the murder of maria yanez and her husband francisco morales, who were shot dead in their oklahoma city home in july 1993. their 14-year-old daughter was woken by gunfire and rang the police. on their way to the house, police arrested george ochoa and osvaldo torres not far from the crime scene. the two men were tried jointly on charges of first degree burglary and first degree murder with malice aforethought. on this latter charge, the prosecution had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that each defendant intended to kill the victims. according to the oklahoma court of criminal appeals,  ;the states theory, which is supported by the evidence, shows that torres was not the shooter. in order to o btain a first degree murder conviction, the state therefore had to prove that osvaldo torres personally intended the death of the victim and aided and abetted with full knowledge of the intent of the perpetrator. the state produced some evidence which, although not watertight, tended to show that osvaldo torres was present at or near the crime. the evidence in support of the aiding and abetting theory was not strong, however, with no evidence presented that osvaldo torres committed, planned or helped to plan the murders, or knew that his co-defendant planned to kill. george ochoa remains on death row, without an execution date. one of the states witnesses, a 15-year-old girl, testified that the man she saw with george ochoa before the crime had carried a gun. the pistol she described at trial, never found, was not the weapon used in the murders. this witness has since recanted her testimony and said that she was coerced by the prosecution into saying that she saw a gun. despite her affidavit, the oklahoma court of criminal appeals relied upon her trial testimony in upholding torress conviction for first degree murder with malice aforethought: the circumstantial evidence supports a finding of intent, particularly given the evidence that torres had a gun with him prior to the killings (emphasis added). the 10th circuit court of appeals has in turn upheld the conviction and death sentence, despite acknowledging that the evidence against torres is susceptible to interpretation. one of the three judges wrote: i do not believe that the evidence is sufficient to support mr torress murder convictions. at the clemency hearing on 7 may, osvaldo torres told the pardon and parole board: ""i'm not going to sit here and tell you i never did anything wrong. he acknowledged that he intended to burgle the house where the victims were shot. he said, however, that ""i never killed anyone, and i never knew george was going to kill anyone."" six of the seven recommendations for clemency made by the state pardon and parole board in capital cases since 2001 have been rejected by governor henry or his predecessor. for more detail see: usa: osvaldo torres, mexican national denied consular rights, scheduled to die , ai index: amr 51/057/2004, 2 april 2004,",1,"george ochoa"

international remains concerned for the mental health of the six men named above, held in solitary confinement in us military custody in guantnamo bay, cuba. the six are the only prisoners so far made subject to the military order on the detention, treatment and trial of certain non-citizens in the war against terrorism signed by president bush on 13 november 2001. those held under the order can be detained indefinitely without charge or trial. they can also be brought to trial before military commissions whose verdicts, including death sentences, cannot be appealed in any court. two of the six, ali hamza ahmed sulayman al bahlul and ibrahim ahmed mahmoud al qosi have been charged with conspiracy to commit war crime and  terrorism. no dates for their trials have been set. all six men are believed to be held in camp echo, the part of the guant namo facility where pre-commission detainees are held (and which has also reportedly been used for punishment). even in the maximum security cells of camp delta, where most of the hundreds of guantnamo detainees are held, the prisoners can communicate between cells, if they share a language. in camp echo, each man is held for 23-24 hours a day in a reportedly windowless cell with no possibility of communication with other detainees. in the case of non-english-speaking detainees, they will not even be able to communicate with the guard stationed outside the cell. prolonged isolation in conditions of reduced sensory stimulation can cause severe physical and psychological damage. in a declaration signed on 31 march 2004, dr daryl matthews, a psychiatrist who visited guantnamo in 2003 on the invitation of the pentagon, states that the solitary confinement places the detainees at significant risk for future psychiatric deterioration, possibly including the development of irreversible psychiatric symptoms. the announcement that these six detainees were subject to the military order came on 3 july 2003. it is not known how soon after this they were transferred to camp echo. salim ahmed hamdan, who has been in us custody since november 2001, was transferred to camp echo in early december 2003. feroz abbasi and moazzam begg are believed to have been held there longer. amnesty international is concerned that any guilty pleas or detainee testimony brought before the military commissions could be the result of the coercive nature of the conditions in which the detainees have long been held without any legal process. the conditions in camp echo likely leave the detainees there even more susceptible to psychological coercion and false confession. according to dr matthewss declaration, salim ahmed hamdan has said that he has considered confessing falsely to ameliorate his situation. amnesty international is further concerned by the claim contained in a legal petition filed in a us federal court on behalf of salim hamdans military lawyer that the authorities have told the prisoner that he shall remain in custody until such time as he wishes to plead guilty to some unspecified crime against the united states in a manner satisfactory to [the authorities], and that his appointed defense counsel is not authorized to mount any legal defense to either his detention or the circumstances of his incarceration, but rather is available only to assist mr hamdan in pleading guilty to some unspecified offense. this would be consistent with the undermining of the presumption of innocence of the guantnamo detainees by senior us officials, including those with control over the commissions, who have routinely labelled the detainees as terrorists and killers. it would also be consistent with the commission process itself which appears designed to secure convictions. amnesty international believes that the military order should be revoked, and that any trial before the commissions  executive bodies, not independent courts  would contravene international fair trial standards. all governments should seek to persuade the usa to abandon these proposed trials and only countenance proceedings that meet international standards, without recourse to the death penalty. on 19 february 2004 united kingdom foreign secretary jack straw said that  ;in the [uk] attorney general's view the military commissions, as presently constituted, would not provide the type of process which we would afford british nationals. on 20 april 2004, the yemeni human rights minister, amat al-aleem alsoswa, said that her government would give al-qaida suspects in yemen open trials before the normal civilian courts: [w]e are trying our best to guarantee these people their basic rights and their right to have clear and open cases, to have an open trial. it is months since the international committee of the red cross, the only international organization to have had access to the guantnamo detainees, said that it had observed a worrying deterioration in the psychological health of a large number of them. the us authorities say that the 34th suicide attempt occurred in january 2004. the rate of such officially reported attempts has declined recently, apparently because the authorities have reclassified such bids as manipulative self-injurious behavior. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible, in your own words: - expressing concern that preparations continue for military commissions despite widespread concern that they will not comply with international fair trial standards; - expressing concern for the mental health of the guantnamo detainees,

27 april. he was sentenced to death in may 1994 for the rape and murder of 17-year-old shari catherine crews in june 1993. james clark had a november 2002 execution date which was stayed by the texas court of criminal appeals following a claim that he had mental retardation. in june 2002, in atkins v virginia , the us supreme court had ruled that the execution of people with mental retardation was unconstitutional as a national consensus against such executions had evolved. the court did not define retardation, although it pointed to definitions used by the american association of mental retardation and the american psychiatric association. under such definitions, mental retardation is found when several attributes are present  generally an iq of less than 70-75 is considered to indicate retardation if coupled with limitations in two or more adaptive skill areas such as communication, self-care, work, and functioning in the community. in addition, the retardation has to have manifested itself before the age of 18. the atkins decision noted that not all people who claim to be mentally retarded will be so impaired as to fall within the range of mentally retarded offenders about whom there is a national consensus. the court left it up to individual states to determine how to comply with the ruling. following his stay of execution, james clarks case was remanded to the trial court for resolution of his mental retardation claim. following an assessment in april 2003, clinical psychologist dr george denkowski, hired by the state, concluded that james clark had retardation  he assessed clarks iq at 65 and concluded that he had the requisite adaptive behaviour deficits. this was the fifth post-atkins capital case that george denkowski had worked on  in one other case he found that the defendant had mental retardation, in the other three he concluded that they did not have this level of impairment. george denkowski found that robert smith had mental retardation, and an iq of 63. the harris county prosecutor accepted this, citing denkowskis expertise, and smiths death sentence was commuted by governor rick perry in march 2003 in line with a recommendation by the board of pardons and paroles. in james clarks case, the denton county prosecution did not accept george denkowskis finding of retardation. it hired another psychologist, dr thomas allen. he concluded that james clark did not have mental retardation and was faking it to avoid execution. the defence had an assessment done by dr denis keyes, a nationally renowned expert whose studies were among those cited by the us supreme court in its atkins decision. dr keyes concluded that james clark has retardation (and an iq of 68). he noted that dr denkowski was nationally recognized for his work in the area of psychology and mental retardation, and that his findings in james clarks case were credible and correct. in contrast to this, dr keyes noted that dr allen did no standardized testing (which is required for diagnosis and for ruling out a diagnosis), [and] has not worked with or researched mental retardation at all. neither dr keyes nor dr denkowski found that james clark had faked his mental retardation during their assessments, something that these experts specifically watched out for. a hearing was held on three days in august and september 2003, during which james clark was present  shackled, handcuffed and forced to wear an electro-shock stun belt. when clarks lawyer asked for the stun belt to be removed, the judge refused, deferring to the county sheriff and simply stating thats not my decision to make. in november 2003, the judge deferred to dr allens conclusions, rejecting those of drs keyes and denkowski. she suggested that james clark was malingering to avoid execution, and concluded that clark does not fall within the classification of mentally retarded capital offenders, who are exempt from the death penalty under atkins . she held that an iq score of 74 clark achieved in 1983 in youth custody was the most reliable indicator of his iq as he would not then have been trying to manipulate his score. the texas court of criminal appeals upheld the judges findings on 3 march 2004. at james clarks original trial, his lawyers made minimal effort to persuade the jury to spare him from the death penalty. they called no mitigation witnesses. the jury was presented with no details of clarks troubled background, including his being abandoned by both his parents by the time he was 15. background information amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases. every death sentence is an affront to human dignity, every execution a symptom of a culture of violence. the death penalty extends the suffering of the murder victim ;s family to that of the condemned. it carries with it the inescapable risk of irrevocable error. arbitrariness is an inevitable outcome of the process to select those who deserve to die for their crimes. a tiny proportion of all those convicted of murder in the usa are executed; the capital selection process is marked by inconsistency and discrimination. international standards require states to prohibit the execution of people with mental retardation, and amnesty international welcomed the atkins decision. however, the fact that the supreme court left it up to states as to how to comply with the ruling opened the door to further inconsistency in the application of the death penalty. for example, on 19 april 2004 in illinois, a judge prohibited the prosecution from seeking the death penalty against randall jarrett because he had registered an iq of 75 (and despite an iq score of 85 on a later test). in contrast, the judge in james clarks case relied on an iq assessment of 74 to allow him to go forward for execution. the different responses by two texas county prosecutors to the findings of their own expert, dr george denkowski, in the cases of robert smith and james clark, raise serious questions about whether prosecutorial discretion will inject arbitrariness into the post-atkins process as it does in the initial stages of the capital process when the decision as to whether to seek the death penalty is taken. amnesty international believes that abolition is the only solution to the inherent flaws of the death penalty. today, 117 countries are abolitionist in law or practice. in contrast, there have been 908 executions in the usa since they resumed in 1977. texas accounts for 321 of these killings. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible in your own words: - expressing sympathy for the family of shari catherine crews, and explaining that you are not seeking to condone the manner of her death or to deny the suffering caused; - noting that two experts, including one hired by the state, have concluded that james clark has mental retardation, and should be exempted from execution under the atkins v virginia decision; - welcoming the states response in the robert smith case, and expressing concern that the states response in james clarks case is inconsistent with this and raises serious questions of arbitrariness; - expressing concern that the jury was not presented with available mitigating evidence; - calling for clemency for james clark. appeals to: (note: in all appeals please include james

detained foreign nationals without delay of their right to have their consulate informed of their detention. the icj found that the usa had violated this provision in 51 of the 52 cases of mexican nationals brought before it by mexico. the torres case was one of only three in which the icj found that the usa had violated all of its various obligations under article 36, including mexicos right to be able to assist with his legal representation. at the time of his arrest, osvaldo torres was an 18-year-old without a lawyer who had had minimal contact with the us criminal justice system. he was registered with the immigration authorities as a resident alien, which would have become known to the police when they conducted a routine background check on him upon his arrest. despite this, the authorities never informed him of his rights under the vccr. mexico only learned of the case in 1996 when his family contacted the mexican consulate for help. by then, osvaldo torres had already been convicted and sentenced to death. timely assistance from the mexican consulate could have prevented the imposition of the death penalty, either by persuading the prosecutor not to seek a death sentence or by assisting the defence at the trial. the crime in question was the murder of maria yanez and her husband francisco morales, who were shot dead in their oklahoma city home in july 1993. their 14-year-old daughter was woken by gunfire and rang the police. on their way to the house, police arrested george ochoa and osvaldo torres not far from the crime scene. the two men were tried jointly on charges of first degree burglary and first degree murder with malice aforethought. on this latter charge, the prosecution had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that each defendant intended to kill the victims. according to the oklahoma court of criminal appeals, the states theory, which is supported by the evidence, shows that torres was not the shooter. in order to obtain a first degree murder conviction, the state therefore had to prove that osvaldo torres personally intended the death of the victim and aided and abetted with full knowledge of the intent of the perpetrator. the state produced some evidence which, although not watertight, tended to show that osvaldo torres was present at or near the crime. the evidence in support of the aiding and abetting theory was not strong, however, with no evidence presented that osvaldo torres committed, planned or helped to plan the murders, or knew that his co-defendant planned to kill. george ochoa remains on death row, without an execution date. one of the states witnesses, a 15-year-old girl, testified that the man she saw with george ochoa before the crime had carried a gun. the pistol she described at trial, never found, was not the weapon used in the murders. this witness has since recanted her testimony and said that she was coerced by the prosecution into saying that she saw a gun. despite her affidavit, the oklahoma court of criminal appeals relied upon her trial testimony in upholding torress conviction for first degree murder with malice aforethought: the circumstantial evidence supports a finding of intent, particularly given the evidence that torres had a gun with him prior to the killings (emphasis added). the 10th circuit court of appeals has in turn upheld the conviction and death sentence, despite acknowledging that the evidence against torres is susceptible to interpretation. one of the three judges wrote: i do not believe that the evidence is sufficient to support mr torress murder convictions. the un safeguards guaranteeing protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty state that in countries which have not abolished the death penalty, capital punishment may be imposed only for the most serious crimes, it being understood that their scope should not go beyond intentional crimes, with lethal or other extremely grave consequences. furthermore,  capital punishment may be imposed only when the guilt of the person charged is based upon clear and convincing evidence leaving no room for an alternative explanation of the facts. as the 10th circuit said, the evidence concerning torress role in the crime, and therefore his eligibility for the death penalty under oklahoma law, is  susceptible to interpretation. in other words, there is room for an alternative explanation of the facts. osvaldo torres is due to have a clemency hearing before the oklahoma pardon and parole board on 7 may 2004. in its judgment of 31 march, the icj found that the clemency process in the usa was not a satisfactory forum for the effective review and reconsideration of the impact of vccr violations on an individuals case. the icj ruled that the examination of the cases must be conducted in the courts. it remains to be seen if the usa complies. in the meantime, the clemency hearing is still scheduled. for more detail see: usa: osvaldo torres,

scheduled to be executed in south carolina on 19 march 2004. he was sentenced to death in 1995 for the murder of a police officer in 1994. on 7 march 1994, major spencer guerry, the 37-year-old deputy police chief of georgetown on the south carolina coast, was shot after he stopped the car david hill was driving. despite being shot in the face, the officer managed to radio for help. a tape recording of his call revealed that he muttered a few words only, including -eh shot me. major guerry died two days later, becoming the first police officer to die in the line of duty in georgetown for almost a century. the crime gained a high profile in this small community  ; the officers memorial service was attended by 1,000 law enforcement officers and hundreds of residents. there was also wide spread local media attention of the case. according to david hills current lawyers, the investigation of the crime was at times amateurish. for example, a police officer drove his patrol car through the victims blood at the crime scene. a photo line-up contained not david hills photograph, but one of a michael hill from mississippi who was several hundred miles away at the time of the shooting. according to the appeal lawyers, suggestive procedures by the police led several witnesses to identify michael hill as the driver of the car. when the mistake was realised, the same witnesses identified david hill as the driver. the prosecutor acknowledged in post-conviction proceedings that the crime had led to a very emotional time, and that investigators were not very orderly [or] organized at the beginning and mistakes were made. david hill was brought to trial for the murder. at times, three television stations had crews in the courtroom, leading the defense to seek their removal on the grounds that a media circus-type atmosphere would interfere with jury selection. the judge denied the motion. it then emerged that one of the jurors selected had lied about his mental health history because of the presence of the cameras. he was disqualified as a juror. when another prospective juror similarly suggested he did not want to reveal personal details on camera, the judge told the juror that i have to do it in this setting you know, [the media] do their own thing. another juror had not revealed that he knew at least five of the states witnesses, as well as the defendant. he remained on the jury, without there being a hearing into whether his relationships jeopardized the defendants constitutional right to a fair and impartial jury. the media noted that there was a large law enforcement presence in the courtroom. a local newspaper, for example, described the extra security in place, and that the courthouse was unusually populated with uniformed county deputies and state troopers and in an unprecedented step a state law enforcement division agent [was] posted behind [the judge]. although the us supreme court ruled in 1986 that the conspicuous, or at least noticeable, presence of guards in a courtroom during trial is not [an] inherently prejudicial practice, it added that we do not minimize the threat that a roomful of uniformed and armed policemen might pose to a defendant's chances of receiving a fair trial. that decision related to a case involving the presence of four additional uniformed police in the courtroom. in david hills trial, there are believed to have been a police presence 10 times as large. the only evidence that the jury heard in david hills defense was the defendants own testimony that he was not the gunman, but that another man in the car had shot major guerry. the jury heard no other evidence that there may have been two people in the car, despite the reported existence of other eyewitness testimony to this effect and of evidence that the states investigators had initially believed that another person was in the vehicle. in opening arguments, the defense lawyer told the jury that the defense would bring in an expert witness  a forensic tape analyst to enhance the recording of major guerrys final transmission  with a view to showing that the officer had said they shot me. however, on the day that the expert witness was due to fly down from nevada, his assistant became seriously ill. the defense asked for a postponement (continuance) of proceedings from the saturday to the following monday so that he could testify. the judge refused to grant their motion. the us court of appeals for the fourth circuit admitted to being troubled by the judges decision, which it said appears to have been made arbitrarily and out of a myopic insistence upon expeditiousness in the face of a justifiable request for delay. it said the decision displayed an apparent inequity in the courts treatment of the parties. where the prosecution asked for a continuance, it was granted, but when hill requested on, it was denied. nevertheless, the fourth circuit said that there had been no prejudice, as it had since transpired that the expert would not have been able to make a definitive conclusion from the enhanced tape. the fourth circuit did not address the possible impact on the jury of the defenses failure to fulfil its promise to present the witness. the jury convicted david hill and the trial moved into the sentencing phase. arguing for execution, the prosecutor urged the jury to consider the lives of prison guards and police officers if david hill were allowed to live:  what about those other police officers, those hundreds of guards in those prisons? what about them? do they have to die too? in contrast to this inflammatory prediction, david hill is reported to have had an exemplary prison record. he has pursued further education and has had articles published in various publications. amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases, regardless of the gravity of the crime, the guilt or innocence of the condemned, or the method used to kill the prisoner. the death penalty is an affront to human dignity and a symptom of a culture of violence, and consumes resources that could otherwise be used towards constructive strategies to combat violent crime and to offer assistance to its victims and their families. in addition, capital justice system in the usa is marked by arbitrariness, discrimination and error. since 1973, 113 people have been released from death row on the grounds of innocence. the latest case occurred on 18 february 2004 in north carolina, the fourth such case in that state, where the legislature is considering a moratorium on executions. there have been three cases in south carolina, which accounts for 28 of the 899 executions in the usa since 1977. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible, in your own words: - expressing sympathy for the family and colleagues of major spencer guerry, explaining that you are not seeking to excuse the manner of his death or minimize the suffering caused; - opposing the execution of david clayton hill; - expressing concern about the reliability of the investigation and the conviction, and expressing concern at the possible impact of the large media and law enforcement presence at the trial; - noting the contrast between the prosecutors inflammatory predictions of david hills future dangerousness and the prisoners record on death

for the murder in 1982 of peggy lerch. on 25 august 1982, a missing persons report was filed with the police concerning peggy lerch and her husband christopher lerch who had not been seen for two weeks. two years later, a friend of william wickline, teresa kemp, was contacted by police who were acting on information received from informants. teresa kemp subsequently testified that william wickline had murdered peggy and christopher lerch on 14 august 1982 after the four of them had consumed large amounts of drugs and alcohol and following an argument over $6,000 that wickline believed the couple owed him for cocaine. teresa kemp testified that william wickline had murdered christopher lerch first, and that she herself had then held the legs of the sleeping peggy lerch while wickline strangled her. she said that william wickline cut up the bodies, put them in bags, and disposed of them in rubbish bins around the city of columbus. the bodies of peggy and christopher lerch have never been found. teresa kemp was not charged with any offence arising from the crime and its investigation, including her reported possession of a machine gun with altered serial numbers and a fitted silencer that was found in her basement when police came to question her. william wickline was tried by a three-judge panel after he waived his right to trial by jury. the judges sentenced him to 20 years to life imprisonment for the murder of christopher lerch and sentenced him to death for the murder of peggy lerch. the aggravating circumstances that made the crime punishable by death was that there was more than one murder and that the second murder was allegedly committed in order to escape detection for the first. arguing for execution, the prosecutor compared the crime to the disposing of jewish bodies at nazi concentration camps during the second world war. the appeal courts have held that this statement was within the latitude afforded to counsel during closing arguments, although one of the courts acknowledged that the prosecutors statement may have been intemperate and better left unsaid. the same ohio appeals court stated that teresa kemps testimony was  the most compelling evidence presented at trial by the state, although the court noted that the testimony was at times unclear, with sequences of events and blocks of time merged and confused. in his clemency petition, william wickline maintains his innocence of the murders and is seeking clemency on the grounds that his death sentence is based upon the uncorroborated testimony of an un-indicted co-conspirator who gained substantial advantages for her assistance to the police and for her testimony. william wicklines petition also argues that his exemplary conduct on death row deserves consideration in the clemency decision. he has reportedly only had one disciplinary write-up in nearly 20 years on death row, has not engaged in violent acts, and has held many jobs during his time in prison, including as a porter and a barber. the clemency petition also cites evidence of his alleged role in helping to bring to a peaceful end a violent disturbance that occurred on death row in the mansfield correctional institution in september 1997, thereby risking his own life and exposing himself to retaliation. during the disturbances, several prisoners were attacked by other inmates. wilford berry was severely beaten by other prisoners for attempting to drop his appeals against his death sentence. according to the clemency petition, william wickline tried to get help for the badly injured wilford berry and prevented further violence against him. the ohio parole board held a clemency hearing for william wickline on 24 february 2004. members of the lerch family appealed to the board to deny him clemency and to allow his execution to go ahead. the board is due to make its non-binding recommendation to governor bob taft on 2 march. background information amnesty international

yokamon hearn are due to be executed in texas on 3 and 4 march respectively. marcus cotton was sentenced to death in november 1997 for the murder of a 27-year-old texas county prosecutor, assistant district attorney gil epstein, who was shot during a robbery in september 1996. marcus cotton's first trial ended in a mistrial when the jurors could not reach a verdict after 21 hours of deliberation. he has professed his innocence. yokamon hearn was sentenced to death in december 1998 for the murder of frank meziere, a 23-year-old stockbroker, who was shot and robbed in march of that year. yokamon hearn and marcus cotton were aged 19 and 22 respectively at the time of the crimes for which they were sent to death row. like many on death row in the usa they came from backgrounds of poverty and deprivation. according to reports, marcus cotton's adoptive mother was a drug addict who routinely abused her children; he himself first took drugs when he was five, and at the age of 10 witnessed his mother shooting his father. yokamon hearn's childhood difficulties reportedly included having an absent father and a mother who used crack cocaine. texas accounts for less than eight per cent of the usa's population but 35 per cent of its executions. since executions resumed in the usa 1977, 899 men and women have been killed in its death chambers. of these, 320 were executed in texas. as a state party to the international covenant on civil and political rights, the usa must provide all death row prisoners with a genuine opportunity to seek commutation of their death sentences. the final safeguard of executive clemency in texas, however, appears to amount to an empty gesture. the board of pardons and paroles (bpp) frequently votes unanimously or near unanimously against clemency, regardless of the issues presented. texas governors have the power to stop executions and to request the bpp to reconsider. they have routinely failed to use their power of reprieve to this end. there have been 81 executions in texas under the current governorship of rick perry, who took office on 21 december 2000. his predecessor, george w. bush, oversaw 152 executions during his five-year term. in texas, 254 of the 320 executions (79 per cent) have been of people convicted of killing whites. studies have consistently shown that race, particularly race of the murder victim, plays a role in who is sentenced to death in the usa. blacks and whites are the victims of murder in almost equal numbers, but 81 per cent of the executions since 1977 have been of people convicted of crimes involving white victims, suggesting that the (overwhelmingly white) system places a higher value on white life. most murders in the usa are intra-racial, that is the victim and perpetrator are of the same race. the most common murder is black-on-black. yet only one in 10 executions (one in 12 in texas) were for black-on-black crimes, whereas one in five executions are of african americans convicted of killing whites. marcus cotton and yokamon hearn are set to become the 70th and 71st african americans executed in texas for killing white victims. in september 2003, larry hayes became the first and so far only white person to be executed in texas for killing an african american. in addition to his black victim, he was also convicted of killing a white person, and he had refused to appeal against his death sentence. all 320 executions carried out in texas since have been by lethal injection. as in many other states, lethal injections are carried out using a combination of three chemicals: sodium thiopental, pancuronium bromide and potassium chloride. there is evidence that the pancuronium bromide, a derivative of curare which paralyses the muscles but does not affect the brain or nerves, may mask the condemned prisoner's suffering during the execution. a person injected with this chemical cannot move or speak. lawyers continue to file claims that a ''chemical veil'' may be masking the reality of the lethal injection process. the use of pancuronium bromide for animal euthanasia is unacceptable under american veterinary medical association guidelines, and its use has been banned in several states. in september 2003, a new law came into force in texas prohibiting its use in the euthanasia of cats and dogs. on 12 february 2004, dissenting against the refusal by his colleagues on the texas court of criminal appeals to stay an execution pending consideration of the constitutionality of the lethal injection process, a judge wrote: ''especially poignant is our own legislature's action in banning the chemical. clearly, the state of texas has acted to eliminate the cruel and inhumane euthanasia of animals by limiting the procedures and chemicals that can be used to euthanize. it stands to reason that what is cruel and inhumane for use in animals is also cruel and inhumane for use in human beings.'' amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases, regardless of the gravity of the crime, the guilt or innocence of the condemned, or the method used to kill the prisoner. the death penalty is an affront to human dignity and a symptom of a culture of violence, and consumes resources that could otherwise be used towards constructive strategies to combat violent crime and to offer assistance to its victims and their families. in addition, the capital justice system in the usa is marked by arbitrariness, discrimination and error. since 1973, 113 people have been released from death row on the grounds of innocence. the latest case occurred on 18 february 2004 in north carolina, the fourth such case in that state, where the legislature is considering a moratorium on executions. a moratorium has been in force in illinois since 2000 because of the state's record of wrongful convictions in capital cases. since 1987 seven texas death row inmates have been released from death rows after evidence of their innocence emerged. it took on average 10 years between conviction and exoneration in their cases. other prisoners have been put to death in texas despite serious doubts about their guilt. recommended action : please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible, in your own words, acknowledging the seriousness of these crimes and expressing sympathy for the victims' families,

every execution is a symptom of a culture of violence, rather than a solution to it. today, 112 countries are abolitionist in law or practice. the united nations commission on human rights has repeatedly called on all retentionist countries to impose a moratorium on executions with a view to abolition, and has urged that the death penalty not be carried out on anyone suffering from a mental disorder. the un safeguards guaranteeing protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty require that capital defendants receive adequate assistance at all stages of the proceedings. in 1998, the un special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions emphasised that all mitigating factors must be taken into account in capital cases. george page is facing execution by lethal injection carried out using a combination of three chemicals: sodium thiopental, pancuronium bromide and potassium chloride. there is evidence that the pancuronium bromide, a derivative of curare which paralyses the muscles but does not affect the brain or nerves, may mask the condemned prisoner's suffering during the execution. a person injected with this chemical cannot move or speak. lawyers around the country continue to file claims that a ""chemical veil"" is masking the reality of the lethal injection process. the last person executed in north carolina was raymond rowsey, put to death on 9 january 2004. the execution went ahead after the us supreme court voted 5-4 to lift a stay imposed by a lower court following an appeal challenging the lethal injection process. there have been 897 executions in the usa since it resumed judicial killing in 1977, 31 of them in north carolina. as evidence has mounted about the discriminatory, arbitrary and error-prone nature of the capital justice system, support for a moratorium on executions has grown. in north carolina, there have been more than 500 resolutions passed in favour of a moratorium on executions in the state. they have been passed by local government authorities, commercial businesses, religious organizations and congregations, political parties, community groups, student bodies, and law firms. more than 20 newspapers in the state have carried editorials supporting a moratorium. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible, in your own words: - expressing sympathy for the family and friends of winston-salem police officer, stephen levi amos, and explaining that you are not seeking to minimize the gravity of his death or the suffering caused; - noting the evidence of george franklin pages history of mental problems, including at the time of the crime, and expressing concern that the jury was not provided with full information of these problems on which to base its sentencing verdict;

military custody in camp delta, guantnamo bay, cuba, have been identified as being the first foreign nationals to be subject to the military order on the detention, treatment and trial of certain non-citizens in the war against terrorism. the military order was signed by president bush on 13 november 2001 and those held under it can be detained indefinitely without charge or trial. they can also be brought to trial before military commissions whose verdicts, including death sentences, cannot be appealed in any court. amnesty international believes that the military order should be revoked, and that any trial before the commissions  which are executive bodies, and not independent courts  would contravene international fair trial standards. the organization is also concerned that any guilty pleas brought before the commissions could be the result of the coercive nature of the conditions in which the detainees have long been held without charge, trial or legal process in guantnamo bay or elsewhere. david hicks, salim ahmed hamdan, ali hamza ahmed sulayman al bahlul and ibrahim ahmed mahmoud al qosi have been assigned military lawyers in preparation for possible trials. the lawyer for salim ahmed hamdan said on 10 february: my client doesnt understand why hes being held. he implores the president to allow him a civilian trial in which he may demonstrate his innocence."" the military lawyer assigned to david hicks said on 21 january: the military commissions will not provide a full and fair trial. the commission process has been created and controlled by those with a vested interest only in convictions."" last month, he and four other military officers assigned to represent defendants at trials by military commission, wrote in an amicus curiae (friend of the court) filed in the us supreme court: the president here asserts the power to create a legal black hole under this monarchical regime, those who fall into the legal black hole may not contest the jurisdiction, competency, or even the constitutionality of the military tribunalsthe governments argument in this case has no logical stopping point. if there is no right to civilian review, the government is free to conduct sham trials and condemn to death those who do nothing more than pray to allah. the presidents claim is for the absence of any legal restraint whatsoever on the government. in the us state departments report on human rights in other countries in 2002, the entry on iran notes: trials in the revolutionary courts, in which crimes against national security and other principal offenses are heard, were notorious for their disregard of international standards of fairness pretrial detention often was prolonged and defendants lacked access to attorneys. the six people named above have been held without access to any legal process for up to 25 months. the entry on cuba states: military tribunals assumed jurisdiction for certain counterrevolutionary cases and were governed by a special law... there was a right to appeal. in the case of the us military commissions, there is no right of appeal to any court. the secretary of defence has selected four people to serve on a review panel as military officers. they will not have to consider petitions from the defence or prosecution, and their recommendations are not binding on the secretary of defence and president for the final disposition in any case. the entry on iraq states that: defendants may appeal to the president for clemency. saddam hussein may grant clemency in any case that suits his political goals or predilections. in the case of the us military commissions, the power of clemency lies with president bush, the official who set up the commissions by executive order and selected the detainees for trial in the first place. the state departments entry on uzbekistan, while critical of the lack of independence of the judiciary, adds that: unlike in past years, when trials of alleged islamic extremists were often closed, local and international trial monitors and journalists were generally permitted to observe court proceedings during the year. in the event that any trials by us military commissions take place, international human rights organizations, including amnesty international, have asked to be allowed to attend as observers. amnesty international recently received a response, in which the pentagon, while not denying the request outright, states that limited courtroom seating and other logistical issues will preclude attendance by many who desire to observe military commission proceedings. background information there are more than 650 people of around 40 nationalities detained without access to lawyers, relatives or the courts in guantnamo bay, where detentions began in january 2002. the us courts have held that they do not have jurisdiction over the detainees, because they are foreign nationals held outside us sovereign territory. the us supreme court has agreed to consider the question of whether the us courts lack jurisdiction, and is due to hear the case in april 2004. numerous parties have filed amicus curiae briefs in support of the detainees and the rule of law, including former us diplomats, former us prisoners of war, retired us military officers, international law professors, legal historians, 175 british parliamentarians, and a consortium of organizations, including amnesty international. there is continuing concern for the psychological well-being of the detainees because of their prolonged indefinite detention. the international committee of the red cross (icrc), the only international organization to have had access to camp delta, has said that it has observed a worrying deterioration in the psychological health of a large number of [the detainees]. there have been numerous suicide attempts, and according to the authorities the 34 th occurred in early january 2004. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible in your own words: - opposing trial by military commission, and expressing concern that preparations continue for them despite widespread concern that they will not comply with international fair trial standards; - in the event that any such trials do take place, calling for international human rights organizations to be allowed to observe the proceedings; - noting us criticisms of trials in other countries, and regretting that by its conduct in relation to the guantnamo detainees, the usa is undermining its claims to be committed to the rule of law; - urging that the guantnamo detainees be charged with recognizably criminal offences, brought to trial, without recourse to the death penalty, in proceedings which meet international standards for fair trial, including the right to appeal, or else released. appeals to: president george w. bush the white house washington, dc 20500",0,"david hicks"

those who consider execution by lethal injection to be a non-violent activity should be asked whether they would characterize as non-violent the action of a private citizen who captured a fellow human being, promised to murder that captive at some time in the future, and after several years, strapped him or her down and killed them by injecting poison into their veins. in the past seven years alone, texas has killed more than 200 people in this way, more than two a month. moreover, lethal injections do not guarantee quick, efficient executions. on 7 december 2000 in texas, for example, claude joness execution was delayed for 30 minutes while the executioners struggled to find a suitable vein in which to insert the needle. they finally inserted it into his leg. in texas, as in many states, lethal injections are carried out using a combination of three chemicals: sodium thiopental, pancuronium bromide and potassium chloride. there is evidence that the pancuronium bromide, a derivative of curare which paralyses the muscles but does not affect the brain or nerves, may mask the condemned prisoner's suffering during the execution. a person injected with this chemical cannot move or speak. when lawyers in tennessee challenged the state's use of this chemical, they presented as a witness a woman who had undergone surgery during which the anaesthetic was not effective. she testified that she was able to hear, perceive and feel everything that was going on in her surgery, but was unable to move or speak because of an injection of pancuronium bromide. she has described the experience as ""worse than death"". lawyers continue to file claims that a ""chemical veil"" is masking the reality of the lethal injection process. the use of pancuronium bromide for pet euthanasia is unacceptable under american veterinary medical association guidelines, and its use has been banned in several states. in september 2003, a new law came into force in texas prohibiting its use in the euthanasia of cats and dogs. the american medical association's code of ethics prohibits doctors from participating in executions. there are reportedly no standards for the training of the non-medical personnel who carry out texas executions, increasing the potential for botched killings. a recent appeal in a texas case points to a law which will come into force on 1 january 2005, and which ""would make the lethal injection process, if performed on animals, illegal, because of the lack of training for the personnel involved, and the lack of safeguards."" recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible, in your own words, opposing these executions and the continuing use of the death penalty in texas. call on the addressees to use their power and influence to do all they can to stop these executions and to lead texas away from the death penalty in line with the global abolitionist trend. appeals to: the honorable rick perry governor of texas state capitol po box 12428 austin, tx 78711",0,"cameron willingham"

executed in texas on 30 march 2004. he was sentenced to death in 1996 for the murder of a 20-year-old white woman, kimberly williamson, in 1995. edward capetillo was 17 at the time of the murder. a fundamental principle of international law prohibits the use of the death penalty against child offenders  anyone who was under 18 at the time of the crime. according to evidence introduced at the trial, on 16 january 1995, 19-year-old twins allison and matt vickers were at home with their friends kimberly williamson and grant barnett. brothers james and curtis duke, together with ryan spillane and michael williams, were at the dukes apartment. the latter group discussed buying marijuana, and selling spillanes gun and electronic scale to matt vickers to obtain the money to do so. after matt vickers declined the offer by telephone, the four, joined by edward capetillo, then discussed robbing him. the five drove to the home of the vickers, edward capetillo armed with a rifle and james duke with spillanes handgun. the situation culminated in the shooting of grant barnett, matt vickers and kimberly williamson. the latter two died. williamson had been shot twice by capetillo. matt vickers had been shot with both weapons. grant barnett survived. at the time of the crime, edward capetillo was a high school student, a promising athlete, and from an unbroken middle class home (this is unusual  the typical child offender on death row in the usa comes from a background of abuse, deprivation and poverty). he did not have a criminal record. at his sentencing, witnesses on his behalf included family members, teachers, friends, and neighbours. to convince the jury that he would be a future danger to society if allowed to live  a prerequisite for a death sentence in texas  the state relied on the facts of the crime, including the teenagers alleged lack of remorse immediately following it, and evidence that he had disciplinary problems at school and was hostile to authority. the jury voted for death. of the four defendants in this case (ryan spillane was not charged), edward capetillo was the only one against whom harris county sought a death sentence. he was also the only one who was not white. james duke (the other presumed shooter) and michael wilson were charged with capital murder. they received life prison terms, and curtis duke received a 20-year sentence for murder. studies have consistently shown that those who kill whites in the usa are more likely to end up with a death sentence than those who kill non-whites. if the defendant is not white, the likelihood of a death sentence may be even greater. whites and blacks are the victims of murder in almost equal numbers, yet of the almost 900 executions since 1977, 80 per cent were of people convicted of crimes with white victims. hispanics represent about 12 per cent of the us population. from 1993 to 1999, the recorded murder rate for hispanics was more than 40 per cent higher than the national homicide rate. less than five per cent of executions carried out since 1977 were for crimes involving hispanic victims. texas accounts for 60 per cent (13 of 22) of the executions of child offenders carried out in the usa since 1977. edward capetillo is the first of three child offenders scheduled for execution in texas before the end of june. all three are hispanic. ten of the 13 child offenders executed in texas were convicted of crimes involving white victims. no white child offender has been executed for killing a black or latino person. nine of the 13 executions have been of black or latino prisoners. of the 28 people under sentence of death in texas for crimes committed when they were 17, six are white, eight are black, one is asian, and 13 are hispanic. at least 16 of the 28 were convicted of crimes involving white victims. only one of the 28 is a white defendant sentenced to death for killing a minority victim. there are currently 10 child offenders on death row who were, like capetillo, prosecuted in harris county. six are hispanic, one is asian and three are black. on 26 january 2004, the us supreme court agreed to revisit its 1989 decision in which it ruled that people who were 16 or 17 at the time of the crimes could be executed. edward capetillos lawyer filed a motion in a texas trial court seeking a stay of execution pending the supreme courts ruling on this issue, expected in 2005. however, on 29 january, the judge rejected the appeal. the harris county district attorney, whose office prosecuted capetillo and the two other people facing execution in june for crimes committed when they were 17, has made it clear that he will pursue all three executions. background information in recognition of the immaturity of children and their capacity for rehabilitation and change, four human rights treaties as well as international humanitarian law (the laws of war), prohibit the use of the death penalty against anyone who was under 18 at the time of the crime. the convention on the rights of the child has been ratified by 192 countries, all but somalia and the usa. in 2002, the inter-american commission on human rights concluded that the prohibition on the execution of child offenders had become a peremptory norm of international law (jus cogens ). the commission noted that the acceptance of this norm crosses political and ideological boundaries and that the norm was binding on all countries, including the usa. no country can legally exempt itself from this global ban. the usa accounts for 54 per cent of the worlds executions of child offenders known since 1990 (19 of 35) and 65 per cent of those reported since 1998 (13 of 20). although there are sporadic executions of child offenders elsewhere, the usa is now the only country which openly acknowledges executing child offenders within its normal criminal justice system and claims for itself the right to do so. iran has been the second worst violator on this issue. however, a bill drafted by the judiciary to raise the minimum age for imposition of the death penalty to 18 was approved by the iranian parliament in december 2003. amnesty international is expecting this bill to be ratified into law. recommended action: please send appeals in your own words. in appeals to the board of pardons please include edward capetillos prisoner number #999185. - expressing sympathy for the family and friends of kimberly williamson and matt vickers, explaining that you are not seeking to condone the manner of their deaths or the suffering caused; - explaining

december 2003 death penalty / legal concern usa (texas)   kevin lee zimmerman kevin zimmerman (m), white, aged 42, has a new execution date after the us supreme court lifted the stay of execution it granted shortly before he was due to be killed on 10 december. sentenced to death in 1990 for the murder of gilbert hooks in 1987, kevin zimmerman is now due to be put to death on 21 january 2004. in late september 1987, kevin zimmerman was released from prison in his native louisiana after serving a three-year sentence for possession of drugs. after he returned home to find that his wife was having an affair with his best friend, he embarked on an alcohol and drug binge with other friends. on the fifth day of this spree, 23 october, kevin zimmerman and two friends were drinking in a motel room in beaumont, texas, when they were joined by fellow motel guest, 33-year-old gilbert hooks. later that night, zimmerman and hooks got into an argument, and hooks stabbed zimmerman in the arm, causing him to bleed profusely. their fight continued and ended in hooks being stabbed to death. kevin zimmerman was charged with murder, not capital murder. he was appointed a succession of lawyers who all withdrew from the case for various reasons, having done little or no work on the case. after a year, zimmerman wrote letters to the prosecutor and court, in effect daring them to charge him with capital murder. in his letters he falsely claimed involvement in other crimes, and claimed that he had robbed hooks. murder during the course of a robbery is a capital offence, unlike plain murder. he was recharged, this time with capital murder. a doctor who recently reviewed the case has stated in an affidavit that the claims in zimmermans letters were patently absurd and that the records indicate that at the time he was  psychotic, potentially suicidal and required suicide prevention measures. in july 1989, kevin zimmerman was appointed the lawyer who would represent him at his capital trial, his fifth attorney since he was first charged. she had no experience in capital cases and had never represented anyone charged with murder. she chose co-counsel who had no capital case experience. the lawyers failed to have zimmerman evaluated for his mental competency to stand trial even though there was evidence that he might not be able to assist in his own defense. they did not investigate his family background, and did not learn that he had a history of mental problems beginning after a serious bicycle accident at the age of 11, as a result of which he had a plate put in his head. there were numerous relatives and neighbors who could have testified that his personality and behavior changed after the accident. the lawyers failed to present expert psychiatric evidence to support the claim of self-defense or to present as mitigation evidence against the death penalty. since the trial a number of experts have concluded that kevin zimmermans brain injury had affected his behavior, including at the time of the stabbing. in 2003, for example, a psychologist concluded that because of this, the crime should not be considered as a predatory/premeditated crime (see original extra). kevin zimmerman faces lethal injection with three chemicals: sodium thiopental, pancuronium bromide, and potassium chloride. pancuronium bromide, a derivative of curare, paralyzes the skeletal muscles but does not affect the brain or nerves. a person injected with it remains conscious but cannot move or speak. legal challenges are being made against its use in executions on the grounds that it may throw a chemical veil over the reality of lethal injections by masking suffering and giving the false appearance of a serene death. in a challenge in tennessee, a woman testified that she had undergone surgery during which the anaesthetic failed. she testified that she was able to hear, perceive and feel everything that was going on in her surgery, but was unable to move or speak because of an injection of pancuronium bromide. she has described the experience as worse than death. the use of pancuronium bromide for pet euthanasia is not acceptable under american veterinary medical association guidelines, and its use has been banned in several states. on 1 september 2003, a new law came into force in texas banning its use in the euthanasia of cats and dogs. the american medical association's code of ethics prohibits doctors from participating in executions. there are reportedly no standards for the training of these non-medical personnel who carry out texas executions, increasing the potential for botched executions. according to kevin zimmermans lawyers, a law which will come into force on 1 january 2005 ""would make the lethal injection process, if performed on animals, illegal, because of the lack of training for the personnel involved, and the lack of safeguards. kevin zimmermans execution was stopped by the us supreme court about 20 minutes before it was due to be carried out on 10 december. lawyers had asked for a stay of execution in a civil rights lawsuit challenging the lethal injection process. the lower courts had dismissed the appeal by recharacterizing it as a procedurally barred successive habeas corpus petition under a different law (see extra update). in december, in the case of david nelson, an alabama inmate challenging his impending lethal injection on the grounds that he has collapsed veins and would have to face painful surgery before being killed, the supreme court agreed to consider the question of courts reconstruing civil rights suits as habeas corpus petitions. on 15 december, the supreme court lifted kevin zimmermans stay of execution, however. four of the nine justices dissented, holding that his case should await the outcome of the nelson case. the five justices in the majority gave no reason for lifting the stay. on 18 de cember, the court upheld a stay of execution for virginia inmate james reid pending its decision in the alabama case. reid has raised a similar complaint to david nelson. prior to kevin zimmermans 10 december execution date, the texas board of pardons and paroles denied clemency although, unusually, two members voted for commutation, at least one of whom did not consider the case to have warranted the death penalty. the governor does not have the power to commute without a recommendation from the board, but he does have the authority to issue a reprieve. further recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible, in your own words, using the above information as you see fit: - explaining that you are not seeking to minimize the seriousness of gilbert hooks killing, or the suffering it has caused; - noting that the prosecution did not initially consider this to be a case of capital murder, and only upgraded it after an intervention by the defendant who was in an apparently psychotic or suicidal state; - expressing concern at the poor quality of kevin zimmermans trial counsel, who failed to present expert evidence of the defendants mental impairment; - noting that since the trial a number of experts have concluded that this mental impairment made it unlikely that the crime was premeditated or that the defendant could conform his conduct to the law; - expressing concern that texas has executed more than 300 prisoners by a method which evidence suggests could be resulting in torturous deaths where the suffering is masked, and noting that animals could not be euthanized under this method under various states laws, including in texas; - calling on the governor to stop kevin zimmermans execution and to ask the board of pardons and paroles to reconsider its earlier decision

physical abuse  whippings three to four times a week, including with extension cords  that williams was subjected to as a child by his father; his witnessing of the physical abuse of his mother by his stepfather; his fathers drug abuse and lewis williamss own resort to illegal drugs, including cocaine, by the age of 13, and lewis williamss low iq (at the age of 11, his iq was assessed as 76). the federal judge also wrote that if the trial lawyers had taken the time to obtain williamss school, juvenile, and treatment records, they would have discovered that his mother had sought psychological treatment for him at the age of 11. the boy had begun running away from home around the age of eight or nine. the jury heard extensive evidence that williams had been in trouble with the law as a juvenile, but were given none of the mitigating background that could help to explain it. the sixth circuit judge wrote that if the trial lawyers had investigated fully, they would have found evidence that the juvenile justice system had failed to meet his psychological and emotional needs. she concluded that: given the wealth of information that the attorneys could have presented regarding williams's troubled life, and the ease with which the attorneys could have obtained such information, it is difficult to imagine how the attorneys failure to conduct a proper investigation and then present meaningful mitigating evidence did not prejudice williams. as in this case, the strickland v washington decision has been a severe barrier to a successful appeal on the grounds of inadequate legal representation. since 1984, the supreme court has only overturned two death sentences on the basis of a violation of strickland . the first, williams v taylor , was in 2000, involving terry williams, a virginia death row inmate. in lewis williamss case the dissenting sixth circuit judge noted the similarity to the case of terry williams: like the six-justice majority in williams v taylor , i believe that a description of lewis williamss childhood, filled with sexual abuse and drug use and exposure to drugs at a young age, and parental neglect might well have influenced the jurys appraisal of williamss moral culpability. then, on 26 june 2003, in wiggins v smith , the supreme court overturned the death sentence of a maryland death row prisoner, kevin wiggins, on the basis that he had received inadequate legal representation. wigginss lawyers failed to investigate his social history and therefore, the court said, could not justify their decision not to present the compelling mitigating evidence that was available. the wiggins decision provides reason to hope for greater judicial scrutiny of the performances of capital trial lawyers. however, lewis williams remains scheduled for execution despite the similarities between his and the wiggins and williams cases in which those death sentences were overturned. international standards require that capital defendants receive such assistance at all stages of proceedings. the united nations special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions has emphasized that all mitigating factors must be taken into account in capital cases. further recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible, in english or your own language, in your own words: - expressing sympathy for the family of leoma chmielewski, explaining that you are not seeking to excuse the manner of her death or to minimize the suffering it will have caused; - expressing concern that the jury heard minimal evidence of the defendant ;s dysfunctional and abusive background on which to base their sentencing decision; - noting that even without this information they evidently had trouble reaching a verdict, suggesting that the mitigating evidence that was available could have persuaded one or more jurors to vote for life; - noting that the federal district judge agreed that the trial lawyers had presented little (if any) relevant mitigating evidence to the jury, and that a sixth circuit judge has said that lewis williamss trial representation had been wholly inadequate at the sentencing phase; - noting the very high threshold for a successful appeal on inadequate legal representation, but that the us supreme court has recently indicated in wiggins v maryland greater judicial scrutiny of trial lawyers conduct, scrutiny that might have allowed lewis williams a successful appeal;

case is the domestic violence that characterized his upbringing. his older brother has stated that their father was an alcoholic who abused us bobby would get the worst of the abuse because he had blond hair and blue eyes. our father thought he was not his child. although we all took severe beatings around the head and body, bobby was most frequently the target of our fathers rage. his mother was physically abused by the father, and the children would witness this violence. bobby hines mother has recalled how the kids were scared all of the time from what they saw at home ; and confirmed that, of the children, bobby definitely got the worst of the abuse. background information texas is the leading death penalty state in the usa. as of 4 december, it had accounted for 312 of the 883 executions carried out nationwide since judicial killing resumed in 1977. texas has violated international law and standards in its pursuit of the death penalty, including by using it against people who were under 18 at the time of the crime, the mentally impaired, the inadequately represented, people whose guilt was in doubt, and foreign nationals denied their consular rights. since the atkins decision in june 2002, texas prosecutors have shown little inclination to take a progressive attitude towards the ruling. for example, in the current case of walter bell, a long-time death row inmate who has a strong claim of mental retardation, the local prosecution is challenging his claim despite having not disputed it at the original trial (at a time when the execution of people with mental retardation was constitutional). in an editorial on 25 november 2003, the austin-american statesman said of the case: in short, the jefferson county prosecutors are hell-bent on executing bell; the truth about his mental state is irrelevant and the requirements of the law are something to be evaded bell's case also is indicative of the failure of the legislature this year to rewrite state law to reflect the supreme court's ruling, and the failure of the executive branch, including the governor, to review the inmates on death row to see which ones should not be there because of mental retardation. recommended action: using the above information, please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible, in english or your own language, calling on the governor to intervene to prevent the execution of bobby hines in the event that the courts do not issue a stay to conduct further proceedings into his claim of mental retardation. please include bobby hines prisoner number #999025 in your appeals appeals to: the honorable rick perry governor of texas state capitol po box 12428 austin, tx 78711",0,"bobby hines"

guest, 33-year-old gilbert hooks. later that night, zimmerman and hooks got into an argument, and hooks stabbed zimmerman in the arm, causing him to bleed profusely. their fight continued and ended in hooks being stabbed to death. kevin zimmerman was charged with murder, not capital murder. he was appointed a succession of lawyers who all withdrew from the case for various reasons, having done little or no work on the case. after a year, zimmerman wrote letters to the prosecutor and court, in effect daring them to charge him with capital murder. in his letters he falsely claimed involvement in other crimes, and claimed that he had robbed hooks. murder during the course of a robbery is a capital offence, unlike plain murder. he was recharged, this time with capital murder. a doctor who recently reviewed the case has stated in an affidavit that the claims in zimmermans letters were patently absurd and that the records indicate that at the time he was  psychotic, potentially suicidal and required suicide prevention measures. in july 1989, kevin zimmerman was appointed the lawyer who would represent him at his capital trial, his fifth attorney since he was first charged. she had no

of mental problems beginning after a serious bicycle accident at the age of 11, as a result of which he had a plate put in his head. there were numerous relatives and neighbours who could have testified that his personality and behaviour changed after the accident. the lawyers failed to present expert psychiatric evidence to support the claim of self-defence or to present as mitigation evidence against the death penalty. the defence also did not investigate gilbert hooks record of violence, including wife-beating and drunken brawls with strangers. since the trial, his fifth wife has testified about his violence and drinking, and another wife has confirmed his violent nature. on one occasion he allegedly beat his pregnant wife so severely that she miscarried. such evidence presented to the jury could have supported the self-defence claim and countered the prosecutions depiction of the victim as non-violent. in 1997, an expert conducted an evaluation of kevin zimmermann, and found that his childhood brain injury had materially affected his behavioral control, both as an adolescent and at the time of the stabbing. the expert concluded that the combination of his alcohol and drug consumption, his anger at having been stabbed, and fear for his safety all contributed to his inability to regain control at the time of the crime. in 1995 another doctor had concluded that zimmerman showed signs of a mental disorder characterized by impaired impulse control and judgment. in 2003, a psychologist concluded that kevin zimmerman had suffered a  traumatic and serious frontal brain injury at the age of eleven which resulted in the development of seizures, personality changes, explosive outbursts as well as post-explosive amnesia. she said that all available information points to mr zimmermans crime as having been one committed under the influence of an explosive encephalopatic rage during which his impulse control, judgment, and memory were grossly

probability that he was suffering from a separate mental illness or disorder at those times. kevin zimmerman, who does not remember details of the stabbing, has consistently expressed remorse over the death of gilbert hooks. kevin zimmerman faces lethal injection with three chemicals: sodium thiopental, a sedative in lethal dose; pancuronium bromide, a muscle relaxant which collapses the diaphragm and lungs; and potassium chloride, which stops the heart. pancuronium bromide paralyzes the skeletal muscles but does not affect the brain or nerves. a person injected with it remains conscious but cannot move or speak. legal challenges are being made against its use in executions on the grounds that it may mask suffering. in such a challenge in tennessee, a woman testified that she had undergone surgery during which the anaesthetic failed. she testified that she was able to hear, perceive and feel everything that was going on in her surgery, but was unable to move or speak because of an injection of pancuronium bromide. she has described the experience as  worse than death. the use of this chemical for pet euthanasia is not acceptable under american veterinary medical association guidelines, and its use has been banned in several states. on 1 september 2003, a new law reportedly came into force in texas banning its use in the euthanasia of cats and dogs. kevin zimmerman is due to be executed on the 55th anniversary of the 1948 adoption of the universal declaration of human rights, with its vision of a world in which the right to life and the right not to be subjected to cruel, inhuman or degrading punishments would be respected. today, 112 countries have abolished the death penalty in law or practice. in contrast, the usa has executed more than 880 people since it resumed judicial killing in 1977. texas accounts for more than 330 of these executions. the un commission on human rights has repeatedly expressed its conviction that  abolition of the death penalty contributes to the enhancement of human dignity and to the progressive development of human rights, and has also called for an end to the execution of anyone suffering from mental disorders. the un safeguards guaranteeing protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty require capital defendants to be provided adequate legal assistance at all stages of the proceedings. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible, opposing the execution of kevin zimmerman, in your own words, using any of the above information as you see fit.

australian national, aged 27 three other non-us nationals, identities and nationalities unknown the uk and australian authorities have continued discussions with the us government on the cases of their nationals who have been made subject to the military order on the detention, treatment and trial of certain non-citizens in the war against terrorism signed by president bush in november 2001. the uk prime minister has indicated that a decision on the uk nationals may be imminent. amnesty international is calling on him and his australian counterpart to reject trials by military commission and not to compromise international fair trial standards in any agreement reached on the cases. it emerged on 3 july 2003 that president bush had identified six foreign detainees in us custody as falling under the provisions of the military order. as such the six can be held indefinitely without charge or trial, or brought to trial before military commissions against whose decisions there would be no right of appeal to any court. amnesty international believes that the military order, which applies only to non-us nationals, should be revoked, and that any trial before the commissions  which are executive bodies, and not independent courts  would contravene international standards. the organization is also concerned that any guilty pleas brought before the commissions could be the result of the coercive nature of the conditions in which the detainees have been held without access to any legal process. uk nationals feroz abbasi and moazzam begg, and australian national david hicks, held in camp delta in the us naval base in guantnamo bay, cuba, were among the six named under the order. amnesty international does not know the identities of the other three detainees, though information received suggests that they may be from pakistan, sudan and yemen. none has had access to a lawyer. while the us authorities have given assurances that the death penalty will not be sought against the uk and australian nationals, no such guarantees are known to have been given in the other three cases. asked about the uk detainees on 23 october 2003 (there are nine uk nationals and three uk residents in guantnamo), prime minister tony blair said i think we are going to bring this to closure one way or another within the next two weekseither you get a trial of these people which we can be satisfied meets the obligations and stipulations that we've got, or alternatively they will come back here [to the uk]. in a recent private meeting with australian prime minister john howard, president bush reportedly promised to expedite the cases of two australian nationals in guant namo, including david hicks. moazzam begg and feroz abbasi are said to be in cells away from the rest of the prisoners, with no access to any other detainee. in the main cell blocks in camp delta, detainees are held in individual cells, but can communicate through the mesh walls of the cells. amnesty international does not know when moazzam begg and feroz abbasi were so placed, or if the other four are also now in increased isolation. in any event, such a move heightens concerns for their mental health. there is growing concern for the psychological well-being of all detainees in guantnamo as detentions there approach their two-year mark. in recent months, the international committee of the red cross (icrc), the only non-governmental organization to have had access to the detainees, has taken the unusual step of making public its concerns on this issue (its findings are generally confidential). in july, icrc spokespersons described how the absence of any clear legal framework had had a very adverse impact on [the detainees] physical and mental well-being. in august, the icrc posted on its website that it had observed a worrying deterioration in the psychological health of a large number of [the detainees]. on 9 october, an icrc spokesperson told the new york times that the open-endedness of the situation and its impact on the mental health of the population has become a major problem. to date, there have been over 30 suicide attempts among the detainees. background information there are more than 650 people from around 40 countries detained in guantnamo bay, where detentions of enemy combatants in the usas war on terror began in early january 2002. none of the detainees has had access to any sort of legal process. efforts to obtain justice in the us courts have been unsuccessful, with the courts holding that they do not have jurisdiction over the detainees, because they are foreign nationals held outside us sovereign territory. on 9 october 2003, former us diplomats, former federal judges, ex-prisoners of war, retired military officers, and the international bar association were among those who filed amicus curiae (friend of the court) briefs in the us supreme court urging it to examine the issue in the interest of justice, international standards, the rule of law, and the reputation of the usa. the court has not yet responded. further recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible, in your own words: to prime minister blair and prime minister howard: - calling on them not to accept trial by military commission under the fundamentally flawed military order, and to obtain return of all of their nationals and residents from guantnamo bay if the us authorities refuse to give them trials that fully meet international standards; - suggesting that any plea arrangements should be viewed with scepticism, given the coercive conditions under which these detainees have been held over a prolonged period of time, and the fact that they have had no access to legal counsel; - urging them to call on the us authorities to end the legal limbo of all those held in guantnamo bay. to president bush: - expressing concern for the psychological well-being of the detainees held in guantnamo bay in view of the indefinite nature of their detention, noting that many have been so held for almost two years; - noting the recent statements of concern by the international committee of the red cross about the mental health impact of this legal limbo, and noting the numerous suicide attempts; - calling for an end to the legal limbo of all guantnamo detainees, urging that they be charged with recognizably criminal offences, brought to trial, without recourse to the death penalty, in proceedings which meet international standards for fair trial, including the right to appeal, or else released; - opposing trial by military commission, and calling for the 2001 military order to be rescinded; - regretting that by its conduct in relation to the guantnamo detainees, the usa is undermining its claims to be committed to the rule of law. appeals to: tony blair prime minister 10 downing street london, sw1a 2aa united kingdom",0,"david hicks"

www.amnestyusa.org/urgent/ extra 46/03   death penalty / legal concern  29 october 2003 usa (georgia)     james willie brown james willie brown (m), white, aged 55, is scheduled for execution in georgia on 4 november. he was sentenced to death at a retrial in 1990 for the rape and murder of brenda watson in 1975. he has a clemency hearing in front of the state parole board on 31 october. it is not known when the board will make its decision. james brown has a long history of mental illness, which has included repeated diagnoses of schizophrenia. at the age of 15, he was diagnosed as suffering from convulsive disorder and prescribed medication to control his seizures. by the age of 17 he had entered the army but served less than two years before eventually being discharged due to his mental illness. as his situation deteriorated, he began to use illegal drugs, and was arrested for the first time in 1968, when he was about 20 years old. he was deemed incompetent to stand trial; that is, that he lacked the mental capacity to fully understand the proceedings or assist in his defence. he was therefore sent to a state mental facility. between the time of his first arrest and his 1981 trial for the murder of brenda watson, he was in mental facilities for 70 per cent of the time, both on an involuntary and voluntary basis. his trial for murder was delayed for six years on the grounds of mental incompetence. he was eventually tried and sentenced to death in 1981, but was granted a new trial by a federal court in 1988 due to doubts over his competency to stand trial in 1981. he was retried in 1990, and again sentenced to death. at the retrial, the defence presented two experts who testified that james brown suffered from chronic paranoid schizophrenia. in a subsequent affidavit, given in 1994, one of these experts stated: mr browns medical history establishes that his mental illness was of a long standing nature... from mr browns post-arrest hospitalization in june 1975 until shortly before his original trial in january 1981, mr brown was under almost constant supervision by mental health professionals at central state hospital. the affidavit continues: considering the type of illness, his extensive medical history and my examination of mr brown, it was my opinion to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that mr brown was psychotic at the time of the alleged offense and that he acted upon delusions and therefore, could not distinguish between right and wrong at the time. based upon my recent review of the additional materials, i stand by my original diagnosis and this opinion. in addition, two inmates who were in the county jail at the time of james browns arrest gave post-conviction affidavits that describe how he was out of touch with reality and psychotic. the states position at the 1990 retrial, however, was that james brown was faking his mental illness. it presented a doctor who stated that, in his opinion, the defendant did not have schizophrenia, but had suffered drug-induced flashbacks. this doctor appears to have ignored james browns long history and repeated diagnoses of mental illness (over the years more than 25 mental health experts employed by the state have found james brown to be mentally ill and not malingering). moreover, in closing arguments, the prosecutor stated to the jury: that brings us to the question that [the defence lawyer] wanted you to consider, should we put the mentally ill to death. well, i dont know the answer to that question... and you don t have to decide that question in this case. because, ladies and gentlemen, this man isnt mentally ill, he has never been mentally ill, and he is not mentally ill today. he was not mentally ill on the [day of the crime]. to bolster the states theory that the defendant was malingering, the prosecution presented a former inmate, anita tucker, who said that james brown had confided in her that he was faking his illness. anita tucker has now recanted that testimony, and testified that her earlier testimony was part of a deal with the prosecution in exchange for her early release on her own criminal charges. like many on death row in the usa, james willie brown comes from a background of poverty, deprivation and serious abuse. according to a 1994 affidavit given by a clinical psychologist, james brown was born in 1948 to a 15-year-old mother and an alcoholic father. theirs was one of the poorest families in a low-income neighbourhood. the children were subjected to routine physical abuse, principally by the father. according to the psychologist:  instruments of abuse included belts, boards, branches, cords, and fists, and the children were also kicked. in addition to beatings of the children, the father also often brutally beat the mother with his fists in front of the children. when [james brown] attempted to aid his mother while she was being beaten, he only earned himself yet another beating from his father... according to [james brown], his brothers and his mother, the fathers beatings were extremely severe, leaving welts, drawing blood, and even, in [his] case, causing unconsciousness. the father not only beat [him] at home but also did so in public, in front of friends and family, and [james brown] reports that the father appeared to take great pride and pleasure in humiliating him like this. the united nations commission for human rights has repeatedly passed resolutions calling for an end to the use of the death penalty against anyone with any form of mental disorder. amnesty international opposes the death penalty unconditionally. while 112 countries are abolitionist in law or practice, the usa has put 878 prisoners to death since resuming executions in 1977, including 58 this year. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible, in your own words: - expressing sympathy for the family and friends of brenda watson, and explaining that you are not seeking to condone the manner of her death or to minimize the suffering caused; - noting that james willie brown has a long history of serious mental illness stemming long before the crime, and that his illness has been recognized by the state on numerous occasions, including when he was in the military and the state hospital; - expressing concern that the prosecution argued to the jury that he had never been mentally ill, and noting that the former inmate who testified at trial that james willie brown was faking his mental illness has since recanted her testimony; - urging clemency for james willie brown in the interest of decency and the reputation of georgia. appeals to: georgia board of pardons and paroles 2 martin luther king, jr. drive, se, suite 458, balcony level, east tower

trial scheduled to begin on 10 november in the commonwealth of virginia, the prosecution is intending to seek a death sentence against lee boyd malvo for a murder he is alleged to have committed when he was 17 years old. international law, binding on all countries, prohibits the use of the death penalty against child offenders  defendants who were under 18 at the time of the crime. john allen muhammad, aged 42, and lee boyd malvo are charged in 10 sniper killings that occurred over a three-week period in october 2002 in virginia, maryland and washington dc. at lee malvos forthcoming trial, the teenager will be tried for the murder of linda franklin who was shot dead in fairfax county, virginia, on 14 october 2002. john muhammad has not yet been brought to trial. following the arrests of the two suspects, us attorney general john ashcroft announced that he had ordered federal agents to transfer lee malvo from federal custody to the local authorities in fairfax county, virginia. he said that his decision was based on a number of considerations, including that the first prosecutions should occur in those jurisdictions that provide the best law and the best range of available penalties. he added that it was imperative that the death penalty be an option. neither federal nor maryland law provides for the death penalty for those under 18 at the time of the crime, but virginia law does. virginia is known for the relative speed at which it takes capital defendants from conviction to execution, and has executed three child offenders since 1998. lee malvos trial, which is expected to last for more than a month, will be held in the city of chesapeake after the judge granted a defence motion for a change of venue from fairfax county. the charges against lee malvo include murder in the commission of an act of terrorism, and his defence lawyers argued that under this theory all residents of fairfax county (from whom the jury would be selected) were victims in this high-profile crime and would therefore not be impartial. the judge decided to transfer the trial to a jurisdiction out of the immediate area where many citizens lived in fear during the month of october 2002 as a result of the crimes with which the defendant is charged. last month, the judge denied a motion in which the defence sought to have the death penalty excluded from the case in line with international law. in an editorial, the washington post wrote: [w]hatever one thinks of capital punishment, it ought not be applied to children, whose personalities and capacities for judgment are not yet fully formed. government takes on, in general, a protective role with respect to children... it is an abdication of that protective role for state governments, even in prosecuting terrible crimes, to respond to youth crime by seeking execution. to sentence someone to die for a crime committed as a child, one has to believe that  in the long natural life the defendant would otherwise have before him  meaningful change and some measure of redemption are either impossible or unimportant. there are good reasons why the rest of the world has rejected executions of children. the paper described such use of the death penalty as an abhorrent policy. background information the imposition of the death penalty against people who were under 18 at the time of the crime is prohibited by international law, and has been roundly condemned by united nations bodies and experts. the geneva conventions, the international covenant on civil and political rights, the convention on the rights of the child, the american convention on human rights and the united nations safeguards guaranteeing protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty, all have provisions exempting this age group from execution. in october 2002, the inter-american commission on human rights concluded:  the acceptance of this norm crosses political and ideological boundaries and efforts to detract from this standard have been vigorously condemned by members of the international community [t]his proscription binds the community of states, including the united states. since 1990, the usa has executed 19 child offenders, compared to 14 such executions reported in the rest of the world combined. these 14 occurred in democratic republic of congo, iran, nigeria, pakistan, saudi arabia, and yemen. yemen and pakistan have now abolished such use of the death penalty in law. iran is reported to be considering such legislation. the usa is responsible for 13 of the 18 executions of child offenders known to have been carried out worldwide since january 1998, and for all four of such executions reported since january 2002. in october 2002, four of the nine us supreme court justices wrote that the execution of people for crimes committed when they were under 18 years old was ""a relic of the past and is inconsistent with evolving standards of decency in a civilized society. we should put an end to this shameful practice. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible, in your own words: - expressing sympathy for the family and friends

a week later he recanted and implicated his brother and henry hunt. a.r. barnes was charged with conspiracy, and elwell barnes and henry hunt were charged with capital murder (elwell barnes was also sentenced to death, but died in prison in 2001 while awaiting a resentencing hearing). - in 1989 elwell barnes signed an affidavit that he (elwell barnes), his brother a.r. barnes, and others  but not henry hunt  committed both murders, and that henry hunt had nothing to do with either murder. - the state bureau of investigation and the lumberton police department destroyed files on the investigation of the case before henry hunts appeal lawyers were able to review them. - jerome ratleys account of the killing of larry jones conflicts with the physical evidence of that murder. two reconstruction experts recently concluded that the murder of larry jones could not have happened the way that jerome ratley related to the trial jury. - the prosecution withheld evidence that, in interviews with police, larry jones had not mentioned henry hunt in relation to jackie ransoms death; at the time, larry jones was implicating rogers locklear as the person responsible for the murder. this would tend to undermine the states theory of henry hunts motive for killing larry jones. - with the exception of the cigarette butt, no physical evidence links henry hunt to either murder. prosecutors introduced a shovel into evidence which they claimed henry hunt had used to bury one of the victims. the jury was left unaware that the soil on the shovel did not match the soil in which the victim had been buried. - initial witness statements conflicted with each other, and it was only as they changed over time that the discrepancies were eliminated. for example, bernice cummings, henry hunts former girlfriend, provided testimony that linked him to the murder weapon. she had initially told police that she knew nothing about a gun. in subsequent months, her account changed several times. another state witness, jim delton freeman, whose testimony also linked henry hunt to the murder weapon, also changed his account various times. many of the people who testified for the prosecution were either involved in the murders or had reason to deflect blame away from themselves. rogers locklear and dottie ransom, who admitted that they conceived and arranged jackie ransoms murder, pleaded guilty and served fewer than five years each in prison. a.r. barnes served less than eight years in prison for conspiracy to murder. jerome ratley was not charged. jim delton freeman was facing 10 to 15 years imprisonment on a parole violation at the time of henry hunts trial. after he testified, the parole violation charge against him was not pursued. henry lee hunt was previously the subject of extra 04/03 issued 15 january 2003. he was scheduled to be executed on 24 january 2003, but received a stay of execution just 35 hours before his scheduled execution. background information amnesty international is not in a position to know if henry lee hunt is guilty or innocent, and opposes his execution in any event. it notes, however, that the case displays some of the factors present in cases of wrongful conviction in other capital cases in the usa  such as prosecutorial withholding of evidence and the reliance on questionable accomplice testimony. the un safeguards guaranteeing protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty state: capital punishment may be imposed only when the guilt of the person charged is based upon clear and convincing evidence leaving no room for an alternative explanation of the facts. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: - expressing sympathy for the family and friends of jackie ransom and larry jones, and explaining that you are not seeking to excuse the manner of their death or minimize the suffering caused;

hicks (m), australian national, aged 27 and three other non-us nationals, identities and nationalities unknown on 3 july, it was revealed that president bush had named six foreign nationals in us custody as being the first to be subject to the military order on the detention, treatment, and trial of certain non-citizens in the war against terrorism which he signed on 13 november 2001. under the order, the six can be held indefinitely without charge or trial, or brought to trial before military commissions with the power to hand down death sentences against which there would be no right of appeal. according to the department of defence, president bush has determined that there is reason to believe that each of these enemy combatants was a member of al-qaida or was otherwise involved in terrorism directed against the united states . it is now the responsibility of the appointing authority, currently deputy secretary of defence paul wolfowitz, to decide whether to approve any charges brought by military prosecutors and whether to appoint a military commission to try those charged. the pentagon has not made the identities of the six public, stating that because no charges against any of the detainees have been approved, their names will not be released. however, it has emerged that moazzam begg, feroz abbasi and david hicks are among the six detainees. these three men are being held in the us naval base in guantnamo bay, cuba. amnesty international believes that the military order should be revoked, and that any trial before the military commissions would contravene international standards: the commissions will lack independence from the executive. the executive has the power to name who will be tried by the commissions, to appoint or to remove commission members, to pick the panel that will review convictions, and to make the final decision in any case. there will be no right of appeal to an independent and impartial court established by law. the commissions can pass death sentences. under international standards, governments must ensure particular respect for all fair trial rights in capital cases, including the right to appeal. the right to counsel of choice and to an effective defence is restricted. defendants will be provided with military lawyers and would have to pay to retain a civilian lawyer. among other restrictions, civilian lawyers may not have access to classified information or closed proceedings. in addition, lawyer/client confidentiality is not guaranteed. us citizens cannot be subject to the military order and will not be tried by military commission, even if accused of the same offence as a foreign national. international law prohibits discrimination on the basis of nationality with regards to fair trial rights. the commissions would allow a lower standard of evidence than is admissible in ordinary courts anyone named under the military order shall not be privileged to seek any remedy or maintain any proceeding in any court anywhere in the world. this would cover any remedy sought for any human rights violation that may have occurred at the time of arrest, during detention, or during trial by military commission. even if acquitted by a commission, the prisoners would not necessarily be released until the end of the war on terrorism, which on 3 july 2003 a senior defence official said is  open-ended. background information more than 650 people from some 40 countries are being held without charge or trial in guantnamo bay. most of the detainees have been held for more than a year in conditions which may amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. they have not had access to any court, to legal counsel, or visits from relatives. they have been subject to repeated interrogations and confinement to small cells for up to 24 hours a day with minimal opportunity for exercise. several have attempted suicide. the conditions under which they have been held raise concerns about the type of evidence that may be introduced against them if brought before military commissions, the guidelines for which do not expressly exclude statements extracted under coercion, including a coercive detention regime. many of the detainees, including feroz abbasi and david hicks, are believed to have been captured in afghanistan at the time of the international conflict there. others have been taken into custody in other countries, including bosnia-herzegovina and gambia. moazzam begg was allegedly seized from a flat in pakistan in early 2002 and, despite a habeas corpus petition pending in court in pakistan, was secretly transferred to afghanistan where he was held in us custody for a year before being transferred to guantnamo in february 2003. other detainees have been held incommunicado in us custody in afghanistan and at undisclosed locations elsewhere outside the usa. it is thought that any trials by military commission and any resulting executions would likely take place at guantnamo bay. on 7 july, the un special rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers expressed his alarm at the naming of the detainees under the military order. he said that the usa was defying un resolutions that any measure taken to combat terrorism must be in accordance with international law. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as

indiana on 13 june 2003. he was sentenced to death in 1990 for the august 1988 murders of his former girlfriend susan bowsher and her two young children, ashlyn bowsher, aged 2, and one-year-old william bowsher. all three were shot dead. joseph trueblood initially pleaded guilty to shooting susan bowsher, and not guilty to the murder of the children. even before this, truebloods then lawyer indicated to the judge that he believed his client should plead guilty and that he planned to loosen [trueblood] up by taking him to the site where the bodies had been buried and by showing him videos of the exhumations. sentencing for the murder of susan bowsher was deferred until after the trial for the childrens murders. on the second day of this trial in february 1990, the prosecution introduced gruesome photographs of the childrens dead bodies, and joseph truebloods twin brother testified for the state that joseph had confessed to all three killings. at the end of that day, the defense attorneys, with the assistance of their clients mother, convinced joseph trueblood to withdraw his not guilty plea and to plead guilty to the murder of the children. the absence of a plea arrangement suggests that the lawyers believed that if he pled guilty, the judge would not sentence him to death. the trial judge ordered a pre-sentencing report by a probation officer. the latter interviewed joseph trueblood. in that interview, at which his lawyer was not present, trueblood denied killing the children, but said that he had pleaded guilty because he believed a jury would sentence him to death. based on this statement, truebloods trial attorneys sought to have trueblood withdraw the guilty plea, and to themselves be allowed to withdraw from the case. their motions were denied. joseph trueblood testified in court that he had not killed the children, and that he had only changed his plea because he believed that a jury would wrongly convict him. the judge told trueblood that his testimony was counterfeit. after a sentencing hearing in april 1990, the judge sentenced joseph trueblood to death. the indiana supreme court upheld the death sentence. however, in july 2001 a federal judge ruled that the indiana courts finding that truebloods plea of guilty to the murder of susan bowsher had been knowing and voluntary had been unreasonable. this, he said, was because trueblood had not been advised that his guilty plea was also an admission of an  aggravating circumstance, i.e. an additional factor making him eligible for the death penalty if he was later convicted of killing one or both of the children. the federal judge said that he cannot imagine a greater consequence in a capital case than this. the federal judge also found that the indiana supreme court had unreasonably applied us supreme court precedent when it found that joseph truebloods lawyer had acted competently when he advised his client to plead guilty to the murder of susan bowsher. he wrote that the defense lawyers failure to understand the full consequences of the plea and failure to explain those consequences to trueblood cannot be considered adequate representation. however, the state appealed against the federal judges finding that joseph trueblood should receive a new trial, and in august 2002 the us court of appeals for the seventh circuit reinstated the death sentence. like many on death row in the usa, joseph trueblood comes from a background of abuse, and is mentally impaired. in post-conviction investigations, a mental health expert concluded that joseph trueblood suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of his abusive childhood. prior to the 1990 trial, a clinical neuropsychologist found that joseph trueblood had brain damage and sub-average intellectual functioning. this testimony was not presented to the trial judge, because the trial lawyers thought it would suggest that joseph trueblood was not amenable to rehabilitation, and that the neuropsychologists testimony would therefore conflict with that of another expert whom the defense presented on the issue of the defendants rehabilitative potential. however, the trial lawyers never asked the two experts for their view of this potential conflict, and in post-conviction proceedings both experts testified that, in their view, joseph trueblood would adapt well to the structured life of prison and that there would have been no conflict between their testimonies. at a clemency hearing before the indiana parole board on 27 may 2003, evidence was presented of joseph truebloods exemplary prison record. the board was also asked to consider the fact that he had once saved a womans life who had been trapped in a burning building, and that he had also saved his cousin from drowning. the state presented its case against clemency. a friend of susan bowshers urged the board to allow the execution to go forward. she was quoted as saying: we will be taking the life of a man who has admitted his guilt for the killing of two innocent children and their mother. i only wish joe trueblood could die three times over for the killing of three people. on 28 may, the board voted to recommend that the governor deny clemency. the case is now before the governor. amnesty international opposes the death penalty unconditionally. every death sentence is an affront to human dignity and every execution is a symptom of a culture of violence rather than a solution to it. the death penalty extends the suffering of one family, that of the murder victim, to another, the loved ones of the prisoner. today, 112 countries are abolitionist in law or practice. the usa has put 855 men and women to death since resuming executions in 1977. indiana accounts for 10 of these killings. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: - expressing sympathy for the family and friends of susan bowsher and explaining that you are not seeking

georgia. the crime for which he is set to die took place 30 years ago when he was 19 years old. he is now 49, having already served the equivalent of a life sentence. on 14 may 1973, six members of the same family were murdered near their mobile home in seminole county in the rural southwest corner of georgia: jerry alday aged 35, ned alday aged 62, jimmy alday aged 25, mary alday aged 26, chester alday aged 32 and aubrey alday aged 57. mary alday was also raped. four people were tried for the crime in 1974: carl isaacs, his 15-year-old brother billy isaacs, his half-brother wayne coleman aged 25, and a friend george dungee aged 34. the three adult defendants were sentenced to death. their convictions were overturned on appeal in 1985 on the grounds that pre-trial publicity had prejudiced the fairness of their seminole county trial. at a retrial in another county in 1988, carl isaacs was again sentenced to death and he has been on death row ever since. according to the states case, carl isaacs shot jerry, ned, jimmy and aubrey alday. wayne coleman and george dungee were resentenced to life imprisonment with the possibility of parole. they are still in prison. according to the state's case, wayne coleman killed chester alday and also shot ned alday, while mary alday, who was allegedly raped by wayne coleman and carl isaacs, was killed by george dungee. billy isaacs served 19 years before being released. carl isaacs was diagnosed with cancer in recent years, and had to have his bladder removed. background information since carl isaacs was first sentenced to death in 1974, more than 60 countries have abolished the death penalty in law. today, 112 countries are abolitionist in law or practice. in 1972, in furman v georgia , the us supreme court overturned the usas capital laws because of the arbitrary way in which the death penalty was being handed out, and there was hope that the usa might move toward abolition. however, the supreme court did not find the death penalty to be unconstitutional per se , and state legislatures quickly set about rewriting their capital laws to take account of the furman ruling. in gregg v georgia in 1976, in a decision that would place the usa squarely on the wrong side of history in relation to the death penalty, the supreme court approved the new capital laws. executions resumed in the usa with the execution of gary gilmore in utah in january 1977. since then, more than 840 men and women have been put to death in 32 states and at the federal level. amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases, unconditionally. every death sentence is an affront to human dignity, every execution a symptom of, rather than a solution to, a culture of violence. the death penalty has not been shown to have a unique deterrent effect, carries the risk of irrevocable error, and extends the suffering of one family  that of the murder victim  to another  the loved ones of the condemned. in effect, the death penalty for murder imitates and takes to new heights of calculation what it seeks to condemn, the deliberate taking of human life. the death penalty in the usa is arbitrary, discriminatory, and inevitably cruel. who is sentenced to death is influenced not only by the crime itself, but issues such as race or status of the murder victim or the defendant, where the crime is committed, the quality of legal representation and political considerations. the us capital justice system is characterised by error, both in terms of convictions and sentencing. more than 100 people have been released from death rows since 1973 after evidence of their innocence emerged. a landmark study published in 2000, and covering a 23-year period, found that the error rate in capital cases was 68 per cent. in other words, in almost seven out of every 10 cases, appeal courts had found that the conviction or sentence should not stand. inadequate legal representation and prosecutorial or police misconduct were the main errors. the study expressed grave doubts that the courts were finding all such errors. support for a moratorium on executions has grown over recent years in the usa as the evidence of the unreliability and unfairness of the death penalty system has mounted. however, most politicians have failed to offer human rights leadership, preferring to defer to perceived public support for judicial killing. their failure of leadership has left the usa increasingly isolated on this fundamental issue, and given the lie to the usas self-proclaimed status as the worlds most progressive force for human rights. as of 30 april 2003, there had been 849 executions in the usa since 1977, including 29 in 2003. georgia has carried out 32 executions. recommended action:

physical abuse  whippings three to four times a week, including with extension cords  that williams was subjected to as a child by his father; his witnessing of the physical abuse of his mother by his stepfather; his fathers drug abuse and lewis williamss own resort to illegal drugs, including cocaine, by the age of 13, and lewis williamss low iq (at the age of 11, his iq was assessed as 76, indicating possible borderline mental retardation). the federal judge also wrote that if the trial lawyers had taken the time to obtain williamss school, juvenile, and treatment records, they would have discovered that his mother had sought psychological treatment for him at the age of 11. the boy had begun running away from home around the age of eight or nine. the jury heard extensive evidence that williams had been in trouble with the law as a juvenile, but were given none of the mitigating background that could help to explain it. the sixth circuit judge wrote that if the trial lawyers had investigated fully, they would have found evidence that the juvenile justice system had failed to meet his psychological and emotional needs. the judge concluded that a description of lewis williamss background might well have influenced the jurys appraisal of williamss moral culpability given the wealth of information that the attorneys could have presented regarding williams's troubled life, and the ease with which the attorneys could have obtained such information, it is difficult to imagine how the attorneys failure to conduct a proper investigation and then present meaningful mitigating evidence did not prejudice williams. background information in contrast to the clear majority of countries that have turned their backs on the death penalty, the usa continues to resort to judicial killing. since resuming executions in 1977, more than 840 men and women have been put to death. the imposition of death sentences in the united states continues to be marked by arbitrariness, discrimination and error. eighty per cent of the people executed since 1977 have been put to death for crimes involving white victims, even though blacks and whites are the victims of murder in the usa in approximately equal numbers. most capital defendants are too poor to afford their own lawyer, and so are appointed counsel by the state. many prisoners have been put to death despite compelling evidence that they were denied their right to adequate legal representation. international standards require that capital defendants receive such assistance at all stages of proceedings. in 2000, a landmark study of the us capital justice system was released. it had examined death penalty cases between 1973 and 1995 and found that the rate of prejudicial error in capital cases was 68 per cent. in other words, courts found serious, reversible error in almost seven of every 10 of the thousands of death sentences that were reviewed on appeal during the 23-year study period. the study, conducted at columbia university in new york found that the most common errors were inadequate legal representation and the suppression of evidence by prosecutors or police. the study expressed grave concern that the courts may not be reversing all errors. the power of executive clemency exists to compensate for the rigidity of the judiciary. in 1993, the us supreme court described executive clemency as the fail-safe in the justice system, adding that it is an  unalterable fact that our judicial system, like the human beings who administer it, is fallible. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible, in your own words: - expressing sympathy for the family of leoma chmielewski, explaining that you are not seeking to excuse the manner of her death or to minimize the suffering it will have caused; - opposing the execution of lewis williams and urging clemency in his case; - expressing concern that the jury heard minimal evidence of the defendant ;s dysfunctional and abusive background on which to base their sentencing decision; - noting that even without this information they evidently had trouble reaching a verdict, suggesting that the mitigating evidence that was available could have persuaded one or more jurors to vote for life; - noting the strong dissenting opinion by a federal judge on the sixth circuit court of appeals that lewis williamss trial representation had been  ;wholly inadequate at the sentencing phase; - noting the very high threshold for a successful appeal on inadequate legal representation, and pointing out that the power of executive clemency exists to compensate for the rigidity of the judiciary and harsh or disproportionate sentencing. appeals to: governor bob taft 30th floor 77 south high street columbus, ohio 43215-6117",0,"lewis williams"

57, is scheduled to be executed in georgia on 25 march 2003. he was sentenced to death in catoosa county in january 1988 for the murder of ricky callahan, white, in november 1984. ricky callahan was found dead in a gravel pit in northern georgia near the border with tennessee on 25 november 1984. he had been shot in the head. according to moons current clemency petition, the state convicted the wrong man. it claims that although there was circumstantial evidence against larry moon, he is innocent of the killing, and that a professional hit man, mickey lee davis, was responsible. davis was on the run from the authorities at the time of the callahan murder having allegedly committed the murder-for-hire of cletus price in tennessee a few weeks earlier. cletus price had been shot in the head. hiding in louisiana after the callahan killing, mickey davis is said to have confessed to his cousin that he had killed callahan. after being arrested in 1985 for the murder of cletus price, davis also allegedly confessed to fellow inmates that he had killed ricky callahan. davis later escaped from jail, and was killed in a motorcycle accident in july 1988. larry moons trial for the murder of ricky callahan did not take place until 1988 because he was in custody in tennessee and had to be extradited from there. after the jury found him guilty of the callahan murder, the trial moved into a separate sentencing phase, the phase of a us capital trial when the state argues for execution and the defence argues for leniency. in this case, the prosecution bolstered its case for execution by presenting evidence that moon had committed two other murders in tennessee within a month of the callahan killing. before the georgia trial, larry moon had been sentenced to life imprisonment in tennessee on charges of armed robbery and kidnapping in other crimes, but he was never tried in either of the two killings used by the prosecution at his 1988 sentencing. in the first case levelled against larry moon by the prosecution, the murder of jimmy hutcheson outside a bar on 15 november 1984, the charges were dropped because of lack of evidence. neither was larry moon prosecuted for the second killing, that of thomas dejose on 2 december 1984. larry moon admitted shooting thomas dejose, but maintained that it was an act of self-defence when dejose tried to rob him at knifepoint. larry moons appeals have argued that one of the states witnesses at the sentencing phase, an officer with the tennessee bureau of investigation (tbi), had failed to reveal certain information about the dejose killing which supported moons self-defence claim. firstly the tbi had run a background check on dejose and found that he had an armed robbery conviction and had fled new york to avoid a six-month prison sentence on a drunk driving conviction. secondly, dejose was drunk at the time he died and that the autopsy showed him to be an intravenous drug user who had used drugs shortly before his death. thirdly, the tbi agent failed to reveal that the states eyewitness to the killing, dejoses girlfriend daryl ehrlanger, who was aiding dejoses flight from new york prison, had failed a lie detector test. on appeal, a county superior court judge found that daryl ehrlangers evidence was by all accounts, the most damaging testimony"" against larry moon at the sentencing phase. however, the court found that the evidence strongly supported the claim that ehrlanger had lied and that this was a self-defence case. it found that larry moons trial lawyer had been constitutionally ineffective for failing to adequately investigate the dejose killing, and that the prosecution had acted unconstitutionally by failing to disclose the exculpatory evidence. however, in 1994, the georgia supreme court reversed the lower courts decision and the conviction and death sentence have survived the remaining appeals process intact. in 2001, in another case, the inter-american commission on human rights (iachr) found that the use of evidence of untried crimes at a capital sentencing violated the usas international obligations. it called on the us authorities to act, in particular by prohibiting the introduction of evidence of unadjudicated crimes during the sentencing phase of capital trials. on 6 january 2003, the iachr issued precautionary measures in larry moons case urging that he not be executed pending the commissions consideration of the unadjudicated crimes issue in his case. background information amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases, regardless of issues of guilt or innocence, or the seriousness of the crime. there is growing concern in the usa about the reliability of the capital justice system after more than 100 people have been released from death rows after evidence of their innocence emerged. a landmark study of 23 years of us death penalty cases, published by columbia university in 2000, found that capital cases were characterized by serious errors in convictions and sentences, and that the main errors were inadequate legal representation and the withholding of evidence by police and prosecutors. international standards require that capital defendants be afforded adequate legal representation at all stages of proceedings; that prosecutors act fairly, consistently and without any discrimination; and that no execution be allowed to proceed where there is any doubt about the guilt of the condemned prisoner. today 111 countries are abolitionist in law or practice. since resuming executions in 1977, the usa has executed more than 830 prisoners. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: - expressing sympathy for the family and friends of ricky callahan, and explaining that

executed, it will bring to an end a moratorium on executions announced by the previous governor of maryland, parris glendening, on 9 may 2002. governor glendening imposed the moratorium pending the outcome of a university of maryland study which he had commissioned in 2000 to look into the fairness of the states death penalty, particularly geographic and racial disparities in capital sentencing. on 7 january 2003, the final report of the study was released. the study was the most comprehensive conducted in maryland. it analyzed 1,311 murders between 1978 and 1999 which were determined to be  death-eligible, that is, punishable by the death penalty. the study concluded that, even when other factors are accounted for, people who kill white victims are significantly more likely to face the death penalty than killers of non-whites. it also concluded that prosecutors in different counties exhibit considerable variation in their pursuit of the death penalty. in terms of whether a particular  death-eligible murder will be pursued as a capital crime, therefore, clearly the jurisdiction where the homicide occurs matters and matters a great deal. murders in baltimore county are more likely to be pursued as death penalty cases than other counties. steven oken was prosecuted in baltimore county. dawn marie garvin was white. campaigning for the governorship last year, robert ehrlich stated that he would lift the moratorium if he was elected to office, and deal with clemency petitions on a case-by-case basis as and when they came before him. he won the election and took office in january 2003. on 28 january governor ehrlich issued a statement in which he stated that he had asked lieutenant governor michael steele, in light of the university of maryland study, to consult a wide variety of interest groups about how the death penalty is implemented in maryland and to forward any and all recommendations to me for my final decision. the governor also stated that his office had begun to compile information on the steven oken case to aid my decision about the final disposition of mr okens case. the lead researcher on the study has stated that a case-by-case review by the governor could not address the systemic disparities in the capital justice system revealed by the study. steven oken was separately convicted of killing two other women committed within 16 days of the dawn garvin murder. he was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for the murder of his 43-year-old sister-in-law, patricia hirt, and also received a life prison term in maine for the murder of 25-year-old lori ward in that state. background information amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases. capital punishment is a government policy that is a symptom of a culture of violence, rather than a solution to it. today, 111 countries are abolitionist in law or practice. in contrast, the usa has already executed 10 people this year, bringing to 830 the number of people it has put to death since executions resumed in 1977. maryland accounts for three of these executions. there are 12 people on death row there, eight blacks and four whites. all were convicted of killing white people. nine were prosecuted in baltimore county. national disquiet about the fairness and reliability of the us capital justice system has grown, not least as the number of innocent people found on the countrys death rows has risen. in january 2000, illinois governor george ryan halted executions in his state because of its record of wrongful convictions in capital cases. three years later, governor ryan commuted the death sentences of all the prisoners on death row in illinois. he had recognized that the capital justice system was haunted by the demon of error, error in determining guilt, and error in determining who among the guilty deserves to die. he pointed to race and geography as unacceptable factors in capital sentencing in his state. on 29 january, in an open letter to the maryland governor, lt. governor and members of the state legislature, the attorney general of maryland, joseph curran, called for abolition of the death penalty in his state: despite everyones best efforts, as any trial lawyer or judge knows, our criminal justice system sometimes gets it wrongthe system is a human institution. it is administered by human beings subject to human fallibility. unrecognized mistakes are inevitable executing an innocent person is a mistake for which there is no correction. other troubling issues afflict the death penalty. many people are raising serious questions about geographic and racial disparities in its application. in 1994, a us supreme court justice said: even under the most sophisticated death penalty statutes, race continues to play a major role in determining who shall live and who shall die. the un special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions wrote following his visit to the usa in 1997: ""race, ethnic origin and economic status appear to be key determinants in who will, and who will not, receive a sentence of death"". in its report on the usa in 2001, the un committee on the elimination of racial discrimination noted the ""disturbing correlation between race, both of the victim and the defendant, and the imposition of the death penalty..."" the committee urged the authorities ""to ensure, possibly by imposing a moratorium, that no death penalty is imposed as a result of racial bias on the part of prosecutors, judges, juries and lawyers or as a result of the economically, socially and educationally disadvantaged position of the convicted persons."" recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible, in your own words: -

www.amnestyusa.org/urgent/ 20 february 2003 extra 15/03    death penalty / legal concern usa (texas)    bobby glen cook bobby cook (m), white, aged 42, is scheduled to be executed in texas on 11 march 2003. he was sentenced to death in 1994 for the murder of edwin earl holder in 1993. the body of edwin holder, a 42-year-old white man, was found on 8 february 1993 in the back of his pick-up truck, which was partially submerged in a river. he had been shot in the head and robbed. three men were charged in connection with the crime. stephen cockroft was sentenced to life imprisonment after being convicted of capital murder. robin jenkins received a 15-year prison sentence for robbery in exchange for testimony against bobby cook who was sentenced to death. in texas, a death sentence can only be imposed if the jury concludes that the defendant would probably commit acts of criminal violence that would constitute a future threat to society, the so-called future dangerousness question. texas prosecutors seeking death sentences have frequently called upon expert witnesses to persuade the jury of the future dangerousness of the defendant in question. the most notorious of these experts has been dr james grigson, a dallas forensic psychiatrist who has testified for the state in over 140 capital trials in texas. dubbed dr death for his conduct in such cases, he repeatedly told capital juries of his absolute certainty that the defendant would commit future acts of violence. in the vast majority of the cases, the jurors voted for death. dr grigson testified at the sentencing phase of bobby cooks trial. he did not examine cook, or make any diagnosis of any disorder, but testified that on the basis of the investigative files of the case, statements given by witnesses and the defendants criminal history (none of cooks prior convictions involved acts of violence against another person), bobby cook  ;most certainly represents a very dangerous threat to society and, in my opinion, he will commit future acts of violence. bobby cooks defense lawyer failed to challenge the credibility of dr grigsons testimony. in 1983, the american psychiatric association (apa) filed an amicus curiae (friend of the court) brief with the us supreme court in a case involving dr grigsons testimony. the apa wrote that the unreliability of psychiatric predictions of long-term future dangerousness is by now an established fact within the profession, and estimated that two-thirds of such predictions were wrong. despite this, the us supreme court ruled in barefoot v estelle that such testimony in capital cases was not unconstitutional. three justices dissented, arguing that when a persons life is at stake  no matter how heinous his offense  a requirement of greater reliability should prevail. in a capital case, the specious testimony of a psychiatrist, colored in the eyes of an impressionable jury by the inevitable untouchability of a medical specialists words, equates with death itself. twenty years on, bobby cook is facing imminent execution following a trial at which such unreliable testimony played a central part. a 1988 report compiled for the dallas county prosecutors office indicated that dr grigsons predictions were highly unreliable, with their accuracy approaching zero per cent. in 1995, after repeated reprimands, dr grigson was expelled from the apa for arriving at a psychiatric diagnosis without first having examined the individuals in question, and for indicating, while testifying in court as an expert witness, he could predict with 100% certainty that the individuals would engage in future violent acts. indeed, in one case he had continued to maintain that his prediction at the trial  that the defendant was on the severe end of the scale of sociopathy and would continue to be a threat to society  had been correct even after the prisoner was released from death row because he was found to be innocent. in 1978, dr grigson apparently acknowledged the unscientific nature of his testimony and the cloak of professional authority it carried, when he was quoted as saying: i think you could do away with the psychiatrists in these cases. just take any man off the street, show him what the guys done, and most of these things are so clear-cut he would say the same things i do. but i think the jurors feel a little better when a psychiatrist says it  somebody thats supposed to know more than they know. background information amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases, unconditionally. the death penalty is a symptom of a culture of violence, not a solution to it. it has not been shown to have any special deterrent effect. it carries the risk of irrevocable error. it denies the possibility of rehabilitation and reconciliation. it extends the suffering endured by the family of the murder victim to the family of another, that of the condemned individual. evidence continues to mount that death sentences in the usa are handed down by a capital justice system characterized by arbitrariness, discrimination and unreliability. authorities in the usa have violated international standards in their pursuit of the ultimate punishment, including by imposing it on defendants who were under 18 at the time of the crime, the mentally impaired, those who were inadequately represented, those whose guilt was in doubt, and foreign nationals denied their consular rights. texas is the leading us death penalty state. there have been 12 executions in the usa so far this year, eight of them in texas. texas now accounts for 297 of the 832 executions carried out nationwide since the usa resumed judicial killing in 1977. at the time of writing, bobby cook was scheduled to become the 300th person to be executed in texas since 1977. for more information see: texas: in a world of its own as 300th execution looms (amr 51/010/2003, 23 january 2003). recommended action: please send appeals to arrive

www.amnestyusa.org/urgent/ ua 46/03     death penalty / legal concern       18 february 2003 usa (oklahoma)     scott allen hain scott hain (m), aged 32, is scheduled to be executed in oklahoma on 3 april 2003 for a double murder committed when he was 17 years old. international law, respected in almost every country in the world, prohibits the use of the death penalty against people who were under 18 at the time of the crime. scott hain and robert lambert (see below) were sentenced to death at separate trials for the murders of michael william houghton, aged 27, and laura lee sanders, aged 22, on 6 october 1987. the two victims had been kidnapped in sanders car, robbed, and forced into the vehicles boot (trunk). the car was then set on fire. scott hain was sentenced to death in may 1988. in 1993, he was granted a new sentencing because of an error in the jury instructions at the original trial. he was eventually re-sentenced to death in 1994. at the time of his arrest, scott hains mother was under court-ordered treatment for alcoholism. his father was also a heavy drinker and spent little time at home. he allegedly used to physically abuse scott, who was also sexually abused by a babysitter when he was about eight. his father introduced him to marijuana when he was nine or 10 years old. the boys school record was poor, he had to repeat several grades, and he dropped out of school around the age of 13. from around that time, he began to get into trouble with the law and spent time in juvenile detention for property offences. he absconded on several occasions. during this time, he was involved in burglary and theft with his father. in july 1987, scott hain, now 17, absconded from a juvenile facility for the last time. for most of the next three months he lived on the streets, and increasingly resorted to alcohol and drugs, including crack cocaine. during this time he met robert lambert, who was four years older, and they became involved in crime in order to obtain drugs. scott hain had no record of violence up to this time. background information robert lambert, who is still on death row, has a claim of mental retardation. he may therefore be protected by the 2002 us supreme court ruling, atkins v virginia , which found that the execution of people with mental retardation is unconstitutional. the court found that such executions contravened  evolving standards of decency in the usa, and that the disabilities of such offenders rendered the use of the death penalty against them disproportionate. the court noted that the international community  overwhelmingly disapproved of such executions. offenders who were 16 or 17 at the time of their crimes can still be subject to the death penalty in the usa under a 1989 supreme court decision, stanford v kentucky . however, the international condemnation referred to in the atkins v virginia decision is even clearer in relation to child offenders than it is for offenders with mental retardation. there is also all but equal evidence of a national consensus in the usa against both categories of execution under the criteria used by the supreme court. in addition, as with offenders with mental retardation, children have characteristics that similarly render the death penalty an excessive sanction against them. for example, young people are vulnerable to peer pressure and the domination of their elders, they are impulsive, immature, have poor judgment, and tend not to see the long-term consequences of their actions. in addition, the profile of the typical condemned teenager is not of a youngster from a stable, supportive background, but rather of a mentally impaired or emotionally disturbed adolescent emerging from a childhood of abuse, deprivation and poverty. for further information see usa: indecent and internationally illegal: the death penalty against child offenders (amr 51/143/2002, september 2002). in october 2002, four of the nine supreme court justices dissented from the courts refusal to revisit its 1989 stanford v kentucky decision on young offenders: there are no valid procedural objections to our reconsideration of the issue now, and, given our recent decision in atkins v virginia , we certainly should do so. the dissenters stated that the execution of people for crimes committed when they were under 18 years old was ""a relic of the past... we should put an end to this shameful practice. the imposition of the death penalty against people who were under 18 at the time of the crime is prohibited by international law, and has been roundly condemned by united nations bodies and officials. the geneva conventions, the international covenant on civil and political rights, the convention on the rights of the child, the american convention on human rights and the united nations safeguards guaranteeing protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty, all have provisions exempting this age group from execution. in october 2002, the inter-american commission on human rights concluded:  the acceptance of this norm crosses political and ideological boundaries and efforts to detract from this standard have been vigorously condemned by members of the international community [t]his proscription binds the community of states, including the united states. since 1990, the usa has executed 18 child offenders, compared to 14 such executions reported in the rest of the world combined. these 14 occurred in democratic republic of congo, iran, nigeria, pakistan, saudi arabia, and yemen. yemen and pakistan have now abolished such use of the death penalty in law. oklahoma executed sean sellers in 1999, the first and so far only person to be put to death for a crime committed at 16 since the usa resumed executions in 1977 (the others were 17). recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible, in your own words: - expressing sympathy for the family and

oklahoma intends to violate an unequivocal principle of international law by executing scott hain who was under 18 at the time of the crime; - noting that four us supreme court justices have described the execution of young offenders as a shameful practice which should be ended, particularly in light of atkins v virginia , a decision which may result in the death sentence of scott hains co-defendant being overturned; - noting that such executions have been roundly condemned across the world, and that oklahoma will cause serious damage to its international reputation by carrying out this execution; - urging the governor to do all in his power and influence to stop this execution and to bring oklahoma into line with global standards of justice and decency. appeals to: governor

adequate mental health services may have spared colburn years of suffering and might have spared his victim's life. it is no secret that texas has inadequate resources for helping the mentally ill lead normal lives. looked at another way, it would be better for all and a service to justice if such serious mental health issues were addressed before there is any need to deal with them within the criminal justice system and on death row."" the us supreme court stopped james colburns execution shortly before it was due to be carried out on 6 november 2002. however, on 21 january 2003, it announced that it was refusing to take his appeal, which had raised questions surrounding his current competency to be executed. repeated resolutions in recent years at the united nations commission on human rights have called on retentionist countries not to impose the death penalty on a person suffering from any form of mental disorder or to execute any such person. there have been 12 executions in the usa this year, eight of them in texas. texas now accounts for 297 of the 832 executions carried out nationwide since the usa resumed judicial killing in 1977. for more information see: texas: in a world of its own as 300th execution looms (amr 51/101/2003, 23 january 2003). also see: usa: james colburn: mentally ill man scheduled for execution in texas (amr 51/158/2002, october 2002). recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible, in your own words: - expressing sympathy for the friends and family of peggy murphy; - noting that james colburn has long suffered from schizophrenia, for which he struggled to get appropriate treatment because he lacked medical insurance, and noting evidence that he was suffering from his illness at the time of the crime, and that he may have been incompetent to stand trial; - noting the repeated resolutions at the united nations calling for the death penalty not to be used against the mentally ill; - calling for clemency for james colburn in the interest of decency and the reputation of texas. appeals to: ( in your appeals, please quote james colburns death row",0,"james colburn"

a blood type shared by 22 per cent of the population - was consistent with the blood type of semen found in natalie bradys body. the assaulted prison staff member testified that he had seen blood on amos kings clothes prior to the altercation with him. however, forensic testing only revealed the blood type of the staff member on the clothing. in addition, the competence of the medical examiner who provided key evidence at the trial has since been called into question. she was forced to retire in 2000 after her work on several cases had been discredited. in 2002, the florida newspaper, the st petersburg times , wrote that it was unknown if her conduct in one such case had been simply inept or disturbingly conspiratorial in [her] zeal to facilitate a conviction, and asked how many other autopsies did [she] botch?. about an hour before he was due to be executed on 2 december 2002, amos king was granted a reprieve by governor jeb bush, to allow for further dna testing on evidence from the crime. the innocence project, a non-profit legal project handling cases where post-conviction dna testing can yield proof of innocence, had informed the governors office of: ""the existence of previously untested evidence and further dna testing that could possibly exonerate amos king. on 5 february 2003, the governor lifted the stay, saying that the dna testing had failed to provide any new evidence. however, the dna testing was reportedly inconclusive, neither incriminating nor exonerating amos king. the innocence project stated that the semen evidence that could have produced definitive results was apparently destroyed by the state years ago, and that the remaining evidence was too degraded to yield results. the project concluded that amos kings case remains an extremely troubling one and that he may well be an innocent man. background information amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases, regardless of issues of guilt or innocence. since the usa resumed executions in 1977, 830 people have been put to death, 54 in florida. national disquiet about the fairness and reliability of the us capital justice system has grown as the number of innocent people found on the countrys death rows has risen. in 2000, illinois governor george ryan halted executions in his state because of its record of wrongful capital convictions. the 14-member commission on capital punishment he appointed to study the states death penalty said it was unanimous in the belief that no system, given human nature and frailties, could ever be devised or constructed that would work perfectly and guarantee absolutely that no innocent person is ever again sentenced to death. in january 2003, governor ryan commuted the death sentences of all the prisoners on death row in illinois, stating that the capital justice system was  haunted by the demon of error, error in determining guilt, and error in determining who among the guilty deserves to die. no such leadership has been offered in florida, despite the fact that it accounts for almost a quarter of the prisoners released from us death rows since 1973 after evidence of their innocence emerged - 23 out of 103 according to the death penalty information center in washington, dc. most recently, rudolph holton (2003) and juan roberto melendez (2002) were released from prison after 16 and 17 years on floridas death row respectively. on 10 february 2003, the st petersburg times asked: just how many men and women on death row have to be shown to be innocent before our governor admits that there is something wrong with the system that puts them there? the united nations safeguards guaranteeing protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty state: capital punishment may be imposed only when the guilt of the person charged is based upon clear and convincing evidence leaving no room for an alternative explanation of the facts. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible, in your own words: -

a week later he recanted and implicated his brother and henry hunt. a.r. barnes was charged with conspiracy, and elwell barnes and henry hunt were charged with capital murder (elwell barnes was also sentenced to death, but died in prison in 2001 while awaiting a resentencing hearing). - in 1989 elwell barnes signed an affidavit that he (elwell barnes), his brother a.r. barnes, and others  but not henry hunt  committed both murders, and that henry hunt had nothing to do with either murder. - the state bureau of investigation and the lumberton police department destroyed files on the investigation of the case before henry hunts appeal lawyers were able to review them. - jerome ratleys account of the killing of larry jones conflicts with the physical evidence of that murder. two reconstruction experts recently concluded that the murder of larry jones could not have happened the way that jerome ratley related to the trial jury. - the prosecution withheld evidence that, in interviews with police, larry jones had not mentioned henry hunt in relation to jackie ransoms death; at the time, larry jones was implicating rogers locklear as the person responsible for the murder. this would tend to undermine the states theory of henry hunts motive for killing larry jones. - no physical evidence links henry hunt to either murder. prosecutors introduced a shovel into evidence which they claimed henry hunt had used to bury one of the victims. the jury was left unaware that the soil on the shovel did not match the soil in which the victim had been buried. - initial witness statements conflicted with each other, and it was only as they changed over time that the discrepancies were eliminated. for example, bernice cummings, henry hunts former girlfriend, provided testimony that linked him to the murder weapon. she had initially told police that she knew nothing about a gun. in subsequent months, her account changed several times. another state witness, jim delton freeman, whose testimony also linked henry hunt to the murder weapon, also changed his account various times. many of the people who testified for the prosecution were either involved in the murders or had reason to deflect blame away from themselves. rogers locklear and dottie ransom, who admitted that they conceived and arranged jackie ransoms murder, pleaded guilty and served fewer than five years each in prison. a.r. barnes served less than eight years in prison for conspiracy to murder. jerome ratley was not charged. jim delton freeman was facing 10 to 15 years imprisonment on a parole violation at the time of henry hunts trial. after he testified, the parole violation charge against him was not pursued. background information amnesty international is not in a position to know if henry lee hunt is guilty or innocent, and opposes his execution in any event. it notes, however, that the case displays some of the factors present in cases of wrongful conviction in other capital cases in the usa  such as prosecutorial withholding of evidence and the reliance on questionable accomplice testimony. the un safeguards guaranteeing protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty state: capital punishment may be imposed only when the guilt of the person charged is based upon clear and convincing evidence leaving no room for an alternative explanation of the facts. on 11 january 2003, the outgoing illinois governor commuted the sentences of all death row inmates in his state. his decision came three years after he imposed a moratorium on executions because of the number of wrongful convictions in capital cases. the commission on capital punishment which he appointed in 2000 to review the capital justice system made various recommendations for its reform, but also unanimously concluded after two years of study that no system, given human nature and frailties, could ever be devised or constructed that would work perfectly and guarantee that no innocent person is ever again sentenced to death. more than 100 people have been released from death rows in the usa since 1973 after evidence of their innocence emerged. today, 111 countries have abolished the death penalty in law or practice. since 1977, 821 men and women have been put to death in the usa. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: - expressing sympathy for the family and friends of jackie ransom and larry jones, and explaining that you are not seeking to excuse the manner of their death or minimize the suffering caused;

as prosecutors know, gays and lesbians are routinely subject to invidious bias in all corners of society...the openly gay defendant thus finds himself at a disadvantage from the outset of his prosecution. when a prosecutor directs the jury to make its guilt-innocence or life-death determination on the basis of anti-homosexual bias, that disadvantage is magnified exponentially and raises constitutional concerns. this is so because prosecutors occupy a position of trust, and their exhortations carry significant weight with juries... justification for these remarks was unquestionably illegitimate. exploiting his position of trust and spinning the reality of anti-gay prejudice to a pivotal position in the capital-sentencing phase, the prosecutor undermined the possibility that petitioners sentence would be based on reason rather than emotion. the united nations guidelines on the role of prosecutors requires that prosecutors perform their duties fairly, consistently and expeditiously, and respect and protect human dignity and uphold human rights, and  carry out their functions impartially and avoid all political, social, religious, racial, cultural, sexual or any other kind of discrimination. the right to freedom from discrimination on the basis of sex, which includes sexual orientation, is recognized in international treaties, including the international covenant on civil and political rights. amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases. today, 111 countries have abolished judicial killing in law or practice. since the usa resumed executions in 1977, 810 prisoners have been put to death nationwide, 52 of them in oklahoma. prosecutorial conduct is one of the issues highlighted in amnesty internationals april 2001 report on the death penalty in oklahoma, old habits die hard (amr 51/055/2001). jay neill has chosen not to have a clemency hearing before the pardon and parole board. amnesty international understands that this is in order to spare the murder victims families more suffering. in the absence of a recommendation from the board, the governor of oklahoma has the authority to grant temporary reprieves. he should do so here, and use his power and influence to achieve commutation of jay neills death sentence. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: - explaining that you are not seeking to minimize the seriousness of the crime, or the suffering it will have caused to many people; - expressing concern at the prosecutors blatant misconduct in raising jay neills homosexuality when arguing for a death sentence against him; - arguing that the prosecutors homophobic conduct must surely undermine confidence in the jurys decision, even for advocates of the death penalty, and also violated international standards for prosecutorial behavior; - calling on the governor to do all in his power and influence to stop this execution in the interests of fairness, equality, decency and the reputation of oklahoma and the usa. appeals to: frank keating governor of oklahoma room 212, state capitol building oklahoma city, ok 73105",0,"jay neill"

[basden] initially thought the idea was crazy and refused. meanwhile, lynwood taylor suggested ideas for sylvia white, including that she make the murder look like suicide. she rejected that idea because she had already had one husband who had been found to have committed suicide and another would look too suspicious (that husband had reportedly suffered arsenic poisoning for a year before being found dead with a gunshot wound to the head). ernest basden became involved in the plot after he became unable to work due to illness and ran into financial difficulties. according to his appeal lawyers, his vulnerable state meant that he was easily pressured into becoming involved by his nephew. as basdens drug supplier, lynwood taylor also knew that basden had a drug and alcohol problem. he allegedly lied to his uncle that billy white was violent towards sylvia white. it was ernest basden who actually shot billy white, with a gun reportedly provided by lynwood taylor. taylor also planned specific details of the crime. not long after the murder, ernest basden voluntarily went to the police, and gave a detailed confession, saying that he had shot billy white because he needed the money. he also said that his nephew had plied him with marijuana, alcohol, cocaine and valium on the day of the murder. ernest basden was the first of the three defendants to be tried. he was appointed a lawyer who was dying from leukemia. despite his illness, which required repeated spells in hospital, the lawyer refused to step down. for almost a year, no significant pre-trial motions were filed in the case. six weeks before the trial, the lawyer withdrew from the case (he died a few months later). the court refused to postpone the trial to allow his replacement more time to prepare. in 2002, the fourth circuit court of appeals acknowledged that at least one of the several claims of ineffective assistance of counsel raised on appeal was particularly troubling. the court also found  troubling the prosecutions withholding of certain evidence from the defence until the first morning of the trial. the jury sentenced ernest basden to death, after a long deliberation, despite finding several mitigating factors. these included the fact that he was under the influence of a mental or emotional disturbance at the time of the crime, was remorseful, had accepted responsibility, was cooperative with the police, and that his character and prior conduct was inconsistent with the crime. the fourth circuit court of appeals noted that the jurys finding that basden was under the domination of taylor and affected by alcohol and drugs at the time of the killing meant that at least one of the jurors... accepted, in sum, that he was an intoxicated, manipulated, rube [bumpkin]. one of the original trial jurors recently expressed the sincere hope that the governor will stop the killing of mr basden as he does not deserve to be killed. another juror recently recalled that throughout the majority of the deliberations, nine of the 12 jurors wanted to give ernest life instead of death. the juror explained that two of the other jurors convinced the rest that ernest basden would be released within a few years if they voted for life. the juror stated that the two jurors also convinced the remainder of the jurors that, if they sentenced basden to death, he would never actually be executed but would simply serve a longer prison sentence than if he was given life. in 1993, sylvia white was convicted of the first-degree murder of her four-year-old stepson. the state did not seek the death penalty. in 1996, she was offered a plea bargain to second-degree murder for her involvement in the murder of billy white. lynwood taylor was offered a plea bargain and had his sentencing postponed for three years. sylvia white and lynwood taylor received prison terms for their role in the billy white murder and will be eligible for parole in 2005 and 2013 respectively. background information amnesty international opposes the death penalty unconditionally. every death sentence is an affront to human dignity, every execution a symptom of a culture of violence, not a solution to it. moreover, the us death penalty, supposedly reserved for the worst of the worst, is characterized by arbitrariness, discrimination and error. today, 111 countries are abolitionist in law or practice. fifty-eight people have been put to death in the usa this year, bringing to 807 the number of executions since 1977. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: - explaining that you are not seeking to excuse the manner of billy white s death, or to minimize the suffering it will have caused; - noting the range of mitigating factors in the case, including ernest basdens long-held remorse and his domination by his co-defendant, lynwood taylor; - noting evidence that the jury had not wanted to sentence ernest basden to death, and noting the states more lenient approach to his co-conspirators, who will be eligible for parole within the next few years; - noting that the fourth circuit court of appeals has described the case as troubling, and expressing concern that ernest basden was represented until shortly before his trial by a lawyer whose terminal illness can only have impaired his preparation, and that the trial court refused to delay the trial to allow the replacement counsel more time to prepare;

he paced back and forth when standing, rocked to and fro when sitting, lost control of his bladder and had to be given dry clothes, and the interrogating officer noticed that he was shaking uncontrollably. referring to the murder of peggy murphy, james colburn told police that he had experienced this flash that i was going to hurt her and said that this one impulse come over me said to kill her... i couldnt stop myself. at the time of the murder, james colburn was being treated on an outpatient basis, although his care was irregular. for periods in pre-trial detention, the montgomery county jail withheld his medication when colburn refused to pay for it. consequently, in october 1994, he was suicidal, and urinating and defecating on himself. two weeks later, he was very agitated and contemplating suicide and was placed in restraints. in may 1995, for example, he was again put in restraints as he reported having auditory hallucinations telling him to kill himself. during his trial in october 1995, james colburn received injections of haldol, an anti-psychotic drug that can have a powerful sedative effect. a lay observer, a nurse with experience of mentally ill patients, has stated in an affidavit that colburn appeared to fall asleep on frequent occasions during the proceedings. in her opinion, his lethargic state prevented him from participating in his defense or even paying attention to his own murder trial. the defense lawyers have stated that they believe that colburn was competent to stand trial, that is that he had a rational understanding of the proceedings and could assist in his defense. however, at one stage of the trial one of the lawyers had to ask for (and was granted) a recess in order that he could walk my client around the room a little bit. hes snoring kind of loud. in an affidavit, the lawyer acknowledged mr colburn dozed occasionally during the trial. the appeal courts have upheld the conviction and death sentence, rejecting evidence that james colburn was not competent to stand trial due to his mental illness and the sedative effect of the haldol injections. in may 2002, the us court of appeals for the fifth circuit wrote: we need not determine the number of times colburn fell asleep during trial because whether colburn fell asleep once or slept through most of his trial is not dispositive of colburns competence. before the trial, the court appointed a psychologist to evaluate whether james colburn was sane at the time of the murder, and whether he was competent to stand trial. the psychologist concluded that he was both sane and competent. however, his examination of colburn was conducted 10 months before the trial. in a post-conviction affidavit, the psychologist said that having learned of the haldol injections and the apparent sedative effect they had on james colburn, it is my opinion that during the trial itself, as opposed to the date on which i examined him...it is not reasonably probable that... mr colburn was legally competent to stand trial. he further suggested that proceedings should have been suspended to adjust mr colburns medication so that he was oriented and aware. a psychiatrist who conducted an assessment of james colburn in 1997, and reviewed the records in the case, concluded that there were serious questions and concerns regarding [colburns] competency to stand trial at that time, and that colburn had been seriously sedated during the time of his trial. background information repeated resolutions in recent years at the united nations commission on human rights have called on retentionist countries not to impose the death penalty on a person suffering from any form of mental disorder or to execute any such person. the national alliance for the mentally ill, a nonprofit support and advocacy organization in the usa, opposes the death penalty against people with schizophrenia and other mental illnesses. since the usa resumed judicial killing in 1977, 804 men and women have been put to death nationwide. texas accounts for 285 of these executions. texas has carried out 29 of the 55 executions this year. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: - expressing sympathy for the friends and family of peggy murphy; - noting that james colburn suffers from paranoid schizophrenia, and has done since he was a teenager; - noting that the appeal courts have upheld the death sentence despite evidence that james colburn may have been incompetent to stand trial including as a result of injections of the anti-psychotic sedative, haldol;

handcuffed, shackled, gagged, and hooded - by car to an airfield and flew him to a secret location, where he was held for about 48 hours before being flown out of pakistan in an us air force plane. during the 12-hour flight to the usa, mir aimal kasi confessed to the 1993 shootings. he allegedly said that he had shot the cia agents because, among other things, he was upset that the usa had bombed iraq, and upset with the cia because of their involvement in muslim countries. mir aimal kasi was handed over to the virginia authorities, and brought to trial in november 1997. he was sentenced to death for the capital murder of frank darling, and to life imprisonment for the first-degree murder of lansing bennett. the appeal courts have upheld kasis conviction and death sentence, rejecting the argument that the trial court did not have jurisdiction over him because he had been illegally abducted from pakistan. the courts have applied us supreme court precedent, including the 1992 decision us v lvarez-machan , allowing the trial in the usa of foreign nationals forcibly abducted abroad by us agents (see below). amnesty international opposes the execution of mir aimal kasi, as it does all executions. every death sentence is an affront to human dignity, every execution a symptom of, not a solution to, a culture of violence. the organization is also concerned that the abduction of mir aimal kasi violated the international legal prohibition on arbitrary detention. background information in 1990, mexican national humberto lvarez-machan, wanted in the usa for his alleged involvement in the murder of a federal agent, was abducted from mexico by agents working for the us. two federal courts ruled that he could not be tried in the usa because his abduction had violated the us/mexico extradition treaty. however, in 1992, the us supreme court ruled that the extradition treaty says nothing about either country refraining from forcibly abducting people from the others territory.... the court acknowledged that the abduction may have violated general international law principles, but was nevertheless not a violation of the extradition treaty because the latter had not been invoked. it concluded that lvarez- machans trial in the usa was therefore not prohibited. three justices dissented. one wrote: i suspect most courts throughout the civilized world will be deeply disturbed by the monstrous decision the court announces today. for every nation that has an interest in preserving the rule of law is affected, directly or indirectly, by a decision of this character. in 1993, the un working group on arbitrary detention concluded that the abduction had been an arbitrary detention - a violation of international law. meanwhile, lvarez-machan, who had been acquitted at his 1992 us trial and returned to mexico, pursued a civil lawsuit against the us. on 11 september 2001, the ninth circuit court of appeals ruled that he could claim damages from the us government. in its decision, the court stated that his abduction had been a violation of customary international law because it violated his rights to freedom of movement, to remain in his country, to security of his person, as well as the right to freedom from arbitrary detention. the governments position had been that various of the countrys laws envision us agents engaged in foreign law enforcement activity and that for this to be effective, their arrest authority must be able to override international law. the ninth circuit stated: if this assertion is an accurate statement of united states law, then it reinforces the critics of american imperialism in the international community. amnesty international has expressed its concern that the usa may seek to undermine human rights protections, including extradition protections, in its war on terrorism announced following the attacks of 11 september 2001 in the usa. see no return to execution: the us death penalty as a barrier to extradition , (november 2001); memorandum to the us government on the rights of people in us custody in afghanistan and guantnamo bay, (april 2002); and pakistan : transfers to us custody without human rights guarantees, (june 2002). since the usa resumed executions in 1977, 802 prisoners have been put to death. virginia accounts for 86 of these executions, second only to texas. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: -

his mother suffered mental illness and made repeated suicide attempts, one of which gary etheridge had witnessed as a child. he was repeatedly raped and physically abused by an older brother starting from when he was six years old. gary etheridge began using drugs and getting into trouble with law from the age of 12. his four brothers, also brought up in this abusive environment, have all been to prison. gary etheridge has attempted suicide on at least two occasions, once after being raped while serving a prison term for a prior, non-violent offence. his severe depression, when left untreated outside prison, contributed to his self-medicating with illegal drugs and to serious drug addiction. he was intoxicated on a combination of heroin and cocaine when the murder of christi chauvierre occurred. despite being aware of such compelling mitigating evidence, etheridges trial lawyers chose not to present any of it. not only did they fear that such evidence could be used by the prosecutor to argue that gary etheridge would be a future danger if allowed to live (a prerequisite for a death sentence in texas), they also recognized that under the texas jury instruction system of the time, the jury had no vehicle to give mitigating effect to such evidence. they were aware of the 1989 us supreme court decision, penry v lynaugh , which found that the absence of such a vehicle in texas rendered a death sentence unconstitutional. however, they did not know how this decision was to be applied, and so they failed either to object to the jury instructions or to present the mitigating evidence. after the penry decision, the defendant in that case, john penry, was resentenced to death in 1990. this death sentence was overturned by the us supreme court in 2001, because the sentencing instructions given at his resentencing were also inadequate. he and three other texas death row prisoners, robert smith, mark robertson and michael blue, sentenced under the same instruction, were granted new sentencing hearings in which the jury would be able to give mitigating effect to evidence presented about the defendants background. this has not happened in gary etheridges case. in december 1996, gary etheridge was appointed a lawyer for his state appeals. this lawyer had only graduated from law school two years earlier and had been licensed by the texas bar in may 1995. he had never represented a capital defendant at trial, and had never filed a state or federal appeal in any case; capital or non-capital. the appeal lawyer failed to raise a sustainable claim that gary etheridges trial representation had been inadequate at the sentencing phase of the 1990 trial. his failure apparently stemmed from his incorrect understanding of this area of the law as it related to texas capital cases. after the texas court of criminal appeals denied gary etheridges appeal in april 1998, the case moved into the federal courts. a new lawyer raised a claim that the trial lawyer had been ineffective at the sentencing phase of the trial. the federal courts have dismissed the claim on the grounds that it had been procedurally defaulted, that is, unavailable for federal review because it was not properly raised in the state courts. since resuming executions in 1977, 789 men and women have been put to death across the usa, 276 of them in texas. texas has regularly violated international law or safeguards in its pursuit of judicial killing. one such safeguard requires that capital defendants receive adequate legal representation at all stages of proceedings, above and beyond that provided in non-capital cases. in 1996, the united nations special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions emphasized that in capital cases all mitigating factors must be taken into account. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible, in your own words: - expressing sympathy for the family of christi chauvierre, and explaining that you are not seeking to condone the manner of her death; - expressing concern that no jury has ever heard the compelling mitigating evidence of gary etheridges appalling background; - expressing concern that his state appeal lawyer failed to properly raise a claim of ineffective trial representation, thereby causing the issue to be procedurally barred from federal judicial review;

sometimes using electric cords and sticks. the texas court of criminal appeals then appointed a lawyer to represent toronto patterson for his appeals. this lawyer had never handled such an appeal. the one he filed for toronto patterson was six pages long. such appeals filed by adequately funded, experienced lawyers can be expected to run to 150 pages because of the number of issues raised and the complexity of the law. toronto pattersons appeal did not challenge his trial lawyers failure to investigate and present the above mitigating issues. because they were not raised in the state courts, such issues have been lost to review by the federal courts. background information toronto patterson was born less than two weeks after the usa signed the international covenant on civil and political rights (iccpr) in 1977, and he was sentenced to death three years after the usa ratified the treaty in 1992. article 6(5) prohibits the use of the death penalty against people who were under 18 at the time of the crime; a prohibition which stems from recognition of a young persons immaturity, impulsiveness, vulnerability to peer pressure, and capacity for rehabilitation. since 1990, the convention on the rights of the child, which carries the same prohibition, has been ratified by 191 countries; all but the usa and somalia. when the usa ratified the iccpr, it filed a reservation purporting to exempt it from the prohibition on the execution on child offenders. the human rights committee, the expert body established by the iccpr to oversee implementation of the treaty, has stated that the reservation is invalid and should be withdrawn. it has confirmed that the prohibition cannot be derogated from, even in times of emergency, and has deplored the usas continuing execution of child offenders. since 1998, there have been 15 executions of child offenders documented worldwide, 10 in the usa (six in texas). yemen and pakistan, two of the six other countries reported to have executed child offenders since 1990, have since abolished such use of the death penalty. it was recently reported that 74 child offenders who had remained on death row in pakistan have had their death sentences commuted. another of the six countries, democratic republic of congo, commuted the death sentences of five child offenders in 2001. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible, in your own words: to all addressees: - acknowledging the seriousness of the crime, and the suffering it will have caused;

office in montgomery county on 22 january 1996. her ankles had been bound with a similar tie wrap, and her wrists bound by red electrical wire. richard kutzner was sentenced to death in september 1997. the state presented strong circumstantial evidence against him, including samples of red wire and plastic ties of the sort used in the murder which had been found in kutzners house and truck. there was also evidence indicating that kutzner had been in possession of a videocassette recorder and computer keyboard similar to ones taken from the murder scene. also presented was a note in harrisons handwriting, dated a few days before the murder, possibly pointing to kutzner as a potential client. kathryn harrisons husband had been the initial focus of the investigation. there was evidence of his abusive conduct towards her and that she had feared that he might kill her. a car of the type and color driven by her husband was seen outside the office around the time of the murder. kathryn harrison used to record telephone conversations with him at the office. at the time of her death, kathryn harrison had been gathering evidence of his infidelity. the recording device was missing from the murder scene. it was found in her husbands vehicle two weeks after the murder, yet it had not been there a week earlier when police had searched the vehicle. her husband said that he could not remember where he had obtained it. police focus shifted to two other men, roy landry and richard kutzner, after they were identified as suspects in a murder that had occurred two weeks

murder charge. richard kutzner has consistently maintained his innocence of the murder of kathryn harrison. he came within 24 hours of execution in july 2001. the texas court of criminal appeals granted a stay to allow consideration of his request to have dna analysis done on fingernail scrapings from the victim and hair evidence from the crime scene, on the grounds that it could implicate someone else as the perpetrator. this was the first attempt by a texas death row prisoner to use a new state law, which came into effect on 5 april 2001, allowing inmates state-paid dna testing where such testing could affect the outcome of the case. the trial court and the court of criminal appeals subsequently denied kutzners motion to have the evidence tested, ruling that it would not have affected the outcome of the trial. in addition to commutation, richard kutzner is requesting a 120-day reprieve so that dna testing of the physical evidence can be carried out. background information amnesty international does not know whether richard kutzner is guilty or innocent of the murder of kathryn harrison, but opposes his execution in any event, as it opposes all use of the death penalty. the organization believes that every death sentence is an affront to human dignity, and every execution a symptom of, not a solution to, a culture of violence. international safeguards hold that those countries which still retain the death penalty must not carry it out against anyone whose guilt is in any doubt, specifically where there is any room for an alternative explanation of the facts. as an abolitionist organization, amnesty international is calling for commutation of richard kutzners death sentence regardless of his guilt or innocence. it submits that under this minimum safeguard, texas should, at a minimum, grant his request for a reprieve to allow dna testing to be carried out. more than 100 people have been released from death rows in the usa since 1973 after evidence of their innocence emerged. in 12 cases, dna testing played a substantial role in the prisoners exoneration. in other cases, dna testing has implicated capital suspects or has failed to exonerate already condemned inmates. for example, on 1 june 2000, 20 minutes before he was due to be executed, ricky mcginn was granted a reprieve to allow dna testing in his case. during presidential campaigning a few days earlier, then governor george w. bush said that he supported dna testing if it helps to settle a case, or erase any doubts or concerns. mcginn was executed on 27 september 2000 after the testing did not exonerate him. since executions resumed in the usa in 1977, 786 prisoners have been put to death. texas accounts for 274 of these killings. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as

so-called future dangerousness. the state presented evidence of t.j. joness short juvenile burglary and vandalism record. it also presented detailed evidence of the smith county shooting, including testimony from the victim. the state presented a psychologist who testified that t.j. jones was a future danger. he had, however, never spoken to or examined the defendant. in contrast to a 1982 us supreme court opinion that chronological age of a minor is itself a relevant mitigating factor of great weight, the expert testified that t.j. joness young age was an aggravating factor. he also stated that his lack of education and consequent lack of job skills made him likely to commit future acts of criminal violence. the defence presented a psychologist who had interviewed and tested t.j. jones over several visits. he found that t.j. jones had an iq of 78, in the borderline retardation range, and had begun using drugs and alcohol at age 13, his continuing use of which exacerbated his grossly poor judgment. the psychologist found that t.j. jones was typically a very passive person and had the emotional and psychological maturity of a 10 to 12 year old. the expert stated: a person at 17, particularly a person who is this immature cannot, should not be judged, i think, on the same basis that you would judge a 25 or 30-year-old. and the reason is simple. development is still taking place in this boy. and we really dont know whats in his future in terms of final and completed development. he also stated that t.j. jones could now be offered rehabilitative treatment, as he could have been if the authorities had offered appropriate intervention when he had come into contact with the juvenile justice system as a younger teenager. not long before the shootings, t.j. jones had been living in a house used by alleged gang members, who had access to guns and were allegedly involved in criminal violence. t.j. jones was the youngest male in the house. the gun used in both offences was given to him by one of the others in the house, a 22-year-old, who allegedly participated in the smith county robbery and the planning of both crimes. two other older male teenagers and a 17-year-old female were also involved in the gregg county crime. various relatives testified on t.j. jones behalf at the trial. his 16-year-old girlfriend, who two months earlier had given birth to their daughter, suggested that peer pressure lay behind the crimes. his grandfather stated that t.j. jones had always been a follower. his mother testified about the beatings she had been subjected to by his father, including when she was pregnant with tj. they separated when tj was a baby. she lived with another man for about two years when tj was about 11 to 12. his violence against her, witnessed by tj, caused him evident distress. she testified that she had sought official help with her son when he quit school at 15 and began to stay away from home, but to no avail. the unequivocal international prohibition on the death penalty for people under 18 years old at the time of the crime is enshrined in the international covenant on civil and political rights (iccpr) and the convention on the rights of the child, the latter ratified by all countries except the usa and somalia. the prohibition stems from the recognition of a young persons immaturity, impulsiveness, vulnerability to peer pressure, and capacity for rehabilitation. since 1998, there have been 15 executions of child offenders documented worldwide, 10 in the usa (six in texas). t.j. jones has asked his lawyer not to seek clemency or any further appeals. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: to all addressees: - expressing sympathy for the family and friends of willard lewis davis, and explaining that you are not seeking to condone the manner of his death; - expressing deep concern that texas is intending to kill t.j. jones, in violation of the fundamental principle of international law prohibiting the death penalty for people who were under 18 at the time of the crime; - pointing out that this prohibition, respected across the globe, stems from a recognition of a young persons immaturity and capacity for change; - noting expert evidence that t.j. jones was a particularly immature teenager, that he had an iq of 78, was involved with older people who provided the gun used in the crimes, and that his mother had sought state help. to the gregg county officials: -

carr (m), white, aged 32, is scheduled to be executed in georgia at 9am on 19 july 2002. he was sentenced to death in 1994 for his role in the murder of 17-year-old keith patrick young in monroe county in 1992. according to the trial evidence, the murder occurred in the early hours of 8 october 1992 following a party at which timothy carr and others consumed large amounts of alcohol, marijuana and hallucinogenic mushrooms. timothy carr, melissa burgeson, keith young, and two 16-year-olds, left the party in the victims car. keith youngs body was found the next day. the two teenagers were tried in juvenile court in 1992 on murder and theft charges. one was found guilty on all counts, and sentenced to 18 months in juvenile detention. the other was convicted on the theft charge only and was ordered to receive counseling. of the two adults, melissa burgeson was tried first. timothy carr was advised by his lawyer to give a full confession to the monroe county prosecutor and to testify at burgesons trial. the lawyer said he had obtained a verbal assurance from the prosecutor that if carr  helped him, he would help carr. the lawyer said that he understood this to mean that carr would receive an offer of life imprisonment in return for a guilty plea. at burgesons trial in 1994, at which the prosecutor sought a death sentence, carr testified that he was very intoxicated at the time of the murder and had been compelled by burgeson to stab young. the prosecutor urged the jury to believe carrs testimony, and described burgeson as the least intoxicated of the suspects, and the moving force behind the crime. he also referred to timothy carr as burgesons puppet. the jury found burgeson guilty of murder, and sentenced her to life imprisonment. in 1999, an investigator from monroe county sheriffs department stated that as far as keith youngs death, i think [burgeson] played just as much a part in it as anybody...i think she instigated it, planned it and everything. he agreed with the prosecutors characterization of carr as burgesons puppet. timothy carr was tried two months after his co-defendant, and repeated his testimony from her trial. this time the prosecutor described carr as the prime mover in the crime. he urged the jury to discredit carrs  feeble defens and to disbelieve his account of having been intoxicated by alcohol and drugs and being influenced by burgeson. the jury, without knowing about burgesons life sentence, her reported history of violence and intimidation, including against carr, sentenced timothy carr to death. in june 2000, a state court judge overturned carrs death sentence. the court had found that his trial lawyer had committed serious errors which prejudiced the defense, including his failure to present a significant amount of mitigating information about [carrs] life history and the circumstances of the crime, including details of [carr ;s] extremely difficult childhood, evidence of physical and sexual abuse suffered by [carr] at the hands of his father, the history of alcoholism and mental illness in his family, evidence of a brain injury suffered at [carr ;s] birth, as well as good character evidence. having heard such evidence since the trial, one of the jurors has stated that it would have been powerful evidence that mr. carr was not the bad, irredeemable person the prosecutor wanted us to see. she continued: having finally heard about the story of tim carrs life, i dearly wish that this information had been presented at trial. it would have made a big difference. if i had had the information summarized here before me at the trial, i would have voted for a life sentence. a georgia jury must be unanimous before it can pass a death sentence. nevertheless, in march 2001 the georgia supreme court reinstated timothy carrs death sentence. on the mitigating evidence issue, the georgia supreme court ruled that the jury had heard enough to make their sentencing verdict reliable. the federal district court and 11th circuit court of appeals dismissed the case in a mere 13 months, a disturbingly short time given the particular importance of federal review in a case where there has been a conflict in state rulings. international safeguards require adequate legal representation for capital defendants at all stages of proceedings, above and beyond that provided in non-capital cases. in 1996, the united nations special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions emphasized that in capital cases all mitigating factors must be taken into account. the un guidelines on the role of prosecutors require prosecutors to at all times maintain the honour and integrity of their profession, and to perform their duties fairly, consistently and expeditiously,...thus contributing to ensuring due process and the smooth functioning of the criminal justice system. the monroe county prosecutor contravened such principles in his effort to achieve at least one death sentence. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible, in your own words: - expressing sympathy for the family and friends of keith patrick young, and

his mother suffered mental illness and made repeated suicide attempts, one of which gary etheridge had witnessed as a child. gary etheridge was allegedly raped by an older brother when he was six years old, as a result of which he had to be hospitalized. he was also allegedly raped when he was in prison prior to the murder of christi chauvierre. the appeal lawyer nevertheless failed to raise a claim that gary etheridge ;s trial representation had been inadequate at the sentencing phase of the 1990 trial. his failure apparently stemmed from his incorrect understanding of the law in this area as it related to texas capital cases. after the texas court of criminal appeals denied the appeal in april 1998, the case moved into the federal courts. a new lawyer raised a claim that gary etheridges trial lawyer had been ineffective at the sentencing phase of the trial. the federal courts have dismissed the claim on the grounds that it had been procedurally defaulted, that is, unavailable for federal review because it was not properly raised in the state courts. background information amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases, regardless of questions of guilt or innocence, the seriousness of the crime, the existence or absence of mitigating evidence, or the method used by the state to kill the prisoner. the organization believes that every death sentence is an affront to human dignity, and every execution a symptom of a culture of violence rather than a solution to it. the victims of violent crime and their families are deserving of respect, compassion and justice;

marvin fugate wallace fugate, white, aged 52, is scheduled to be executed in georgia at 7pm local time on 18 june 2002. he was sentenced to death in 1992 for the murder of his former wife, pattie dianne fugate, in 1991. wallace and pattie fugate were divorced in 1990 after 20 years of marriage. at the time of her death, pattie fugate was living in the former marital home near eatonton in putnam county with their 15-year-old son, mark. on 4 may 1991, wallace fugate, who was living in another town, came to the eatonton house. later that day he shot pattie fugate. wallace fugates defense was that his gun had gone off accidentally as he and his former wife engaged in a physical struggle. however, mark fugate, who was murdered five years later in an unrelated case, testified at the trial that he had seen his father grab [pattie fugate], holding her by the hair, tilt her head back, put the gun in her face, and pull the trigger. the state-appointed defense lawyers did not bring to the attention of the jury mark fugates earlier statement to the police in which he had said: i heard a shot. i saw my mothers head hit the ground. i could not tell if he held her head back or not. this failure to raise the different pre-trial version of the killing in order to challenge the credibility of the states key witness is one of numerous instances where wallace fugates trial representation appears to have been inadequate. for example, the lawyers offered no objections during the two-day trial. they did not seek funding for any experts, such as an independent weapons expert who could have testified (as one did during post-conviction proceedings) that the brand of gun used in the shooting had a manufacturing defect which made it susceptible to accidental discharge. the defense position was even further undermined when, during closing arguments, one of the defense lawyers reportedly argued that the killing was accidental, and the other described it as self-defense. the whole sentencing phase of the trial lasted 64 minutes, its evidentiary portion less than half an hour. the defense presented four mitigation witnesses whose testimony covered only 20 pages of transcript. the lawyers did not do any investigation of wallace fugates medical, military, employment or school history in preparation for the sentencing. on appeal, affidavits were obtained from 13 potential character witnesses who indicated that they would have testified on wallace fugates behalf if asked. during post-conviction proceedings, one of the two trial lawyers recalled that they had shared the work on the case,  particularly on mitigation. he testified that they had divided contacting the potential witnesses between them. however, the other lawyer testified that he had not participated in contacting potential sentencing phase witnesses, and that his co-counsel had talked to whatever had to be talked to. during post-conviction proceedings one of the lawyers reportedly stated that he had heard of neither furman v georgia , the landmark us supreme court decision in 1972 which imposed a de facto moratorium on the death penalty in the usa, nor gregg v georgia , the equally momentous decision in 1976 which allowed executions to resume. background information to win an appeal on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a us prisoner must prove that not only was the trial lawyers performance inadequate, but that it had affected the outcome of the trial. under the us supreme court precedent, strickland v washington (1984), the judicial scrutiny of legal representation must be highly deferential and must indulge a strong presumption that counsel ;s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance. in rejecting wallace fugates claim of inadequate trial counsel, the us court of appeals for the 11th circuit applied an arguably even higher standard, holding that in order to show that counsels performance was unreasonable, the petitioner must establish that no competent counsel would have taken the action that his counsel did take. the 11th circuit was quoting its 2000 decision in chandler v united states , in which it upheld the death sentence of federal death row inmate david ronald chandler. chandler was convicted on the basis of testimony given by the actual killer, who later recanted. chandlers lawyer failed to conduct any sentencing phase investigation. the death sentence was subsequently commuted in january 2001 by president bill clinton in one of his last acts of office, because of doubts about chandlers guilt (extra 03/01 issued 12 january 2001 and update 22 january). when the 11th circuit upheld wallace fugates conviction and death sentence in august 2001, one of the three judges noted: i remain convinced that our court set the acceptable level of attorney assistance for preparation for the penalty phase of a capital case too low in chandler v united states. international safeguards require adequate legal representation for capital defendants at all stages of proceedings, above and beyond that provided in non-capital cases. amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases. it believes that every death sentence is an affront to human dignity, and every execution a symptom of a culture of violence rather than a solution to it. since

white, aged 34, is scheduled to be executed in texas on 25 june 2002 for the murder of his sister and her husband in 1992. the charred bodies of five members of the coulson family were found after firefighters were called to a housefire in houston on 13 november 1992. the dead were robert coulsons adoptive parents, otis and mary coulson, their adopted daughters sarah coulson and robin coulson wentworth, and the latters husband richard wentworth. robert coulson was tried for the murder of robin coulson wentworth (his biological sister) and richard wentworth. the states theory at the june 1994 trial was that robert coulson had committed the murders in order to become the sole beneficiary of his parents $600,000 estate. he had allegedly arranged for his family to be at the house on 13 november 1992, had subdued them, bound their hands, covered their heads with plastic bags, poured petrol on their bodies and set them on fire (the autopsies indicated that the victims had died before the fire from asphyxiation caused by the bags). there was no physical or eyewitness evidence linking him to the crime. the case against him rested on the testimony of his alleged co-conspirator, jared althaus, who was also charged with capital murder but pleaded guilty in return for a 10-year sentence, of which he served five before being released on parole. the prosecution, after many attempts, were allowed to introduce as evidence an envelope and two photographs of it supposedly taken at the murder scene on the night of the murders. the back of the envelope had details of a proposed business loan to robert coulson discussed with his father earlier in the year, and was introduced to corroborate jared althauss claim that coulson had called his father to again discuss business and was expected at the house. the photos showed the envelope in a prominent position on the desk in otis coulsons study, suggesting that his father had placed it there in preparation for this further discussion. in his closing argument, the prosecutor urged the jury to regard the envelope as corroborating jared althauss testimony. during its deliberations at both the guilt and sentencing phases of the trial, the jury specifically requested to see the envelope that was on the desk. on appeal, the state argued that the envelope was a significant piece of evidence simply because it was discovered on top of otis coulsons desk on the night of the murders . affirming the death sentence in 1996, the texas court of criminal appeals (tcca) noted that the probative value of the envelope evidence was that it was found on otis coulsons desk on the night of the murders...[which] tended to show that otis coulson was expecting to discuss appellants business plans around the time of the murders. evidence was subsequently produced showing that the photographs were not taken on the night of the murders, but the following day. a crime scene video did not show the envelope on the desk. it seems that the envelope had been found by investigators in a stack of papers under a paperweight on 14 october 1992 and moved by a police officer to be photographed in a more prominent position on the desk. on appeal, the federal courts agreed that the envelope evidence presented at trial was false, but ruled that it was harmless, despite the apparent importance placed on its location by the prosecutor, the jury, the state on appeal, and the tcca. background information amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases, regardless of questions of guilt or innocence, the seriousness of the

retributive killing is surely not the way to achieve these goals. a clear majority of countries  currently 111  have abolished the death penalty in law or practice. the international community has ruled out the death penalty as a sentencing option in international courts for even the worst crimes  genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. the usas continuing resort to this punishment, often in ways and cases which violate international minimum safeguards, starkly gives the lie to its claims to be a progressive force for human rights in the world. since resuming executions in 1977, 780 men and women have been put to death across the united states, more than 600 of them since 1990. texas accounts for 271 of these executions. sixty-three of these prisoners were prosecuted in a single county, harris county, where jeffery williams was also tried. fifteen of the 31 prisoners executed in the usa this year have been killed in texas. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible, in your own words: - expressing sympathy for the family of barbara pullins, and explaining that you are not seeking to excuse the manner of her death;

the so-called future dangerousness question. the texas court of criminal appeals (tcca) upheld martinezs death sentence in 1996. four of the nine judges dissented, saying that the evidence of his future dangerousness was insufficient to support a death sentence, and that a proper analysis of the relevant precedent demanded that the death sentence be overturned. one of the dissenters wrote: we have the duty of ensuring death sentences are imposed in an evenhanded, rational and consistent manner... today, the majority shirks that responsibility and issues an opinion that insulates jury verdicts from meaningful appellate review... in light of the majority opinion, there is no longer any assurance that the death penalty will not be wantonly or freakishly imposed. another of the dissenters wrote: every murder committed in the course of a robbery is in some way cold-blooded and senseless. each such murder does not, however, merit the death penalty, our most final punishment... this opinion will probably set a precedent ensuring that never again will there be facts that this court will find insufficient to support an affirmative answer to the [future dangerousness question]. the dissent continued that the majority had contorted the facts of the case in order to uphold the death sentence. the tcca then appointed a lawyer to represent johnny martinez for his further, habeas corpus , appeals. this lawyer had never handled such an appeal, and asked the court on several occasions for permission to withdraw from the case. in 1997, the lawyer filed an appeal, without having once spoken to or visited his client, having refused to accept telephone calls from him, and having sent him only one brief letter. the appeal was five and a half pages long. two of the four claims raised comprised 17 lines of text with three inches of margin, with no cases cited. habeas corpus applications filed by adequately funded, experienced lawyers routinely run to more than 150 pages because of the number of issues raised and the complexity of the law. the appeal did not challenge the adequacy of johnny martinezs trial representation, even though his trial lawyer had done little investigation or preparation for the sentencing phase. the tcca dismissed the appeal. one of the judges dissented, citing the brevity and lack of quality of the appeal. he wrote that the merits of the appeal should not be assessed, but that the adequacy of the appeal lawyers performance should be examined. the lawyer himself agreed with the dissent, again asking to withdraw from the case because of his inexperience. new lawyers later appointed for martinezs federal appeals discovered substantial mitigating factors that had not been presented to the trial jury, including evidence that johnny martinez had been subjected to sexual and physical abuse as a child, and of his dysfunctional family background, including his mothers selling and use of heroin. given johnny martinezs youth, intoxication, remorse, cooperation with the police, and non-violent history, such mitigation evidence, the federal appeal lawyers argued, might have affected the sentence. however, the federal courts have ruled that the claim of inadequate trial counsel is procedurally barred from being evaluated because the claim was not raised in the state courts. the federal district court expressed concern at this harsh outcome - given that the issue was lost to judicial review because of the incompetence of the state habeas lawyer - but the federal court considered itself bound by precedent. background information amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases. in the usa it is a punishment supposedly reserved for the worst of the worst. in reality, it is disproportionally reserved for the poor and the inadequately represented. international standards require that capital defendants be provided with adequate legal assistance at all stages of proceedings ;. since the usa resumed executions in 1977, 776 prisoners have been put to death in 32 states. texas accounts for 267 of these executions. there have been 27 executions in the usa this year, 11 of them in texas. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible, in your own words: -

pakistan (two); democratic republic of congo (drc - one); nigeria (one); and iran (three). in 2001, the president of pakistan announced that he would commute the death sentences of all child offenders on death row in his country. amnesty international knows of no executions since december 2000 in the drc, where there is currently a moratorium on judicial killing. napoleon beazley came hours from execution in august 2001. appeals for clemency had come from many quarters. the district attorney of houston county, whose jurisdiction includes the beazley familys home town of grapeland and who is a strong advocate of the death penalty, called for commutation. a former warden of death row in texas, who oversaw 22 executions, also opposes the execution. in a remarkable development, judge cynthia kent, who oversaw napoleon beazleys 1995 trial and who set his execution dates, wrote to governor perry in august 2001 urging clemency, citing the prisoners age at the time of the crime as reason for commutation. eighteen members of the texas legislature then wrote to the governor: we join judge kent in her request for commutation of napoleon beazleys death sentence because we are greatly disturbed by the fact that texas is now almost the sole executioner of child offenders in the world. we desire texas to be in the lead among states and nations in affording her citizens the protection they deserve to be given under universally-recognized, fundamental, human rights norms. at the recent hearing at which his execution date was set, napoleon beazley spoke of his remorse. in chains, weeping, he apologized to all who had been affected by the crime, first and foremost, to mrs luttig and her family. in texas, the governor can grant clemency if the board of pardons and paroles recommends it. in august 2001, it rejected clemency by a vote of 10-6, an unusually high number of votes for commutation. at the time the board was unaware of judge kents appeal. for more information, see too young to vote, old enough to be executed , amr 51/105/2001, july 2001, and death in black and white , amr 51/117/2001, 9 august 2001. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible, in your own words: - expressing sympathy for the family and friends of john luttig, and explaining that you are not seeking to excuse the manner of his death;

(see update to extra 50/00 (amr 51/94/00, 8 june 2000). the execution of wesley baker has been scheduled despite the fact that a university of maryland study into the states capital justice system is not due to be completed until september 2002. its prime focus is the impact of race on capital sentencing. governor glendening commissioned the study after his task force on the fair imposition of capital punishment concluded in 1996 that in maryland the high percentage of african-american prisoners under sentence of death and the low percentage of prisoners under sentence of death whose victims were african-american remains a cause for concern. marylands population is 64 per cent white and 28 per cent black. of the 13 prisoners on its death row in april 2002, nine (70 per cent) were black and four were white. in 12 of the 13 cases (92 per cent) the victims of the crimes were white, although around 75 to 80 per cent of murder victims in maryland are black. since the usa resumed executions in 1977, maryland has executed three prisoners, two black and one white. all three were convicted of killing whites. wesley baker is african american; jane tyson was white. the lt governor of maryland, kathleen kennedy townsend, a likely candidate for the 2002 state gubernatorial campaign, has indicated her support for a moratorium in the event that the study shows that race plays a role in the states death penalty system. geographical disparities are also evident in marylands death penalty system. wesley baker was prosecuted by baltimore county (population 74 per cent white, 20 per cent black), which accounts for 14 per cent of marylands population. of the 13 on death row in maryland, nine (70 per cent) were prosecuted in baltimore county, a jurisdiction which accounts for less than 10 per cent of the states murders. a major study of the us death penalty at columbia law school names baltimore county as one of the us counties with the highest death sentencing rates, as well as the highest error rates in capital cases. recommended action: please send appeals, in your own words, using the following guide: in appeals to both addressees: - expressing sympathy for the family of jane tyson, and explaining that you are in no way seeking to excuse the manner of her death; - expressing deep concern at the imminent execution of wesley baker; - noting residual doubts about whether he was the gunman, and praising governor glendenings principled stand in the eugene colvin-el case because of such doubts; - noting that this case involves precisely the sort of racial, as well as geographical, disparities that have raised serious questions about marylands capital justice system; - stating that in addition to the residual doubt, it would be unconscionable to allow any execution to go ahead before the results and recommendations of the study commissioned by governor glendening are known. in appeals to governor parris glendening: - urge him to commute wesley bakers death sentence, and to impose a moratorium on executions in maryland. in appeals to lt. governor kathleen kennedy townsend: - noting her support for a moratorium in the event that the study shows that race has played a role in capital sentencing, and requesting her to urge governor glendening to commute wesley bakers death sentence. appeals (in equal numbers) to: the honorable parris glendening governor of maryland state house, annapolis, maryland 21401",0,"wesley baker"

such a thing would dishonor my sons memory... killing mr johnson, even if he is guilty, will not bring my son back and serves no purpose. killing mr johnson if he is innocent would be an abomination. amnesty international opposes all executions unconditionally. it also points out that the united nations safeguards guaranteeing the protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty state: capital punishment may be imposed only when the guilt of the person charged is based upon clear and convincing evidence leaving no room for an alternative explanation of the facts. this execution would clearly flout this safeguard. indeed, as the state supreme court noted, even judge william keesley admitted that the crime may have happened differently from the scenario used to convict richard johnson. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible, in your own words: - expressing sympathy for the family of state trooper bruce smalls, explaining that you are not seeking to excuse the manner of his death; - expressing deep concern that the state intends to kill richard johnson, despite continued doubts about his guilt, noting the dissents in the state supreme court, and the united nations safeguards; - expressing concern that the 1988 jury never knew that connie hess had recanted her 1986 trial testimony; - pointing out that co-defendant and jailhouse informant testimony is notoriously unreliable, and that such testimony has been the source of many errors around the country in death penalty cases; - urging the governor not to participate in an irrevocable injustice, but to commute richard johnsons death sentence. appeals to: governor jim hodges office of the governor po box 11829 columbia, sc 29211",0,"richard johnson"

[he] said it all. someday i want to grow up to be just like [christopher]. to be just like him. spare those kids of that. the eighth circuit also found these comments to be improper and to have no place in an american courtroom, and admonish[ed] the prosecutor to consider the implications of placing the burden of an execution on the shoulders of a child, even if that burden exists only in the child s mind or in prosecutorial rhetoric. the court still upheld the death sentence. under the united nations guidelines on the role of prosecutors, adopted in 1990, prosecutors must at all times maintain the honour and dignity of their profession and perform their duties fairly, consistently and expeditiously, and respect and protect human dignity and uphold human rights. background information the guidelines on the role of prosecutors also state that prosecutors must be made aware of human rights and fundamental freedoms recognized by national and international law. in this case, the prosecution violated international law in seeking the death penalty against christopher simmons. the execution of people for crimes committed when they were under 18 violates the international covenant on civil and political rights and the convention on the rights of the child. the prohibition on the imposition of the death penalty against child offenders is so widely respected that it has become a principle of customary international law, binding on all countries, regardless of which treaties they have or have not ratified. the last execution of a child offender in missouri was that of frederick lashley, killed on 28 july 1993 for a crime committed when he was 17. since christopher simmons was arrested the following month, there have been 17 executions of child offenders documented worldwide, 10 of them in the usa. the others were in democratic republic of congo (1), iran (3), nigeria (1), and pakistan (2). last year, pakistans president announced that he would commute the death sentences of all young offenders on death row there. there have been 769 executions in the usa since judicial killing resumed there in 1977. missouri accounts for 57 of these executions. there have been 20 executions nationwide this year, four of them in missouri. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: - expressing sympathy for the family and friends of shirley cook, explaining that you are not seeking in any way to excuse her murder; - expressing concern that missouri intends to kill christopher simmons, in violation of international law, respected in almost every country, which prohibits the execution of people who were under 18 at the time of the crime, in recognition of the immaturity of young people and their potential for rehabilitation; - noting that the power of executive clemency exists to compensate for errors and inequities in the legal system, and that the governor can now consider the mitigating evidence that the jury never heard, as well as taking full account of the improper arguments of the prosecution; - urging the governor to commute this death sentence in the interest of justice, decency, international law, and the reputation of his state. appeals to: governor bob holden missouri capitol building, room 218 po box 720 jefferson city, mo 65102-0720",0,"frederick lashley"

a 14-year-old girl and a 43-year-old man. both parents were alcoholic, and his father subjected him and his siblings to severe physical violence. he and his brothers would reportedly often turn up at school with black eyes, broken noses or bruises. in addition, tracy housel sustained numerous serious childhood head injuries in accidents and as a result of beatings by his father. testimony relating to housels background from 20 lay witnesses - including family, teachers and neighbors - has been presented on appeal. all said they would have testified at the trial if they had been asked. instead the jury heard brief testimony from three witnesses in a defense presentation that took less than 30 minutes. furthermore, the jury heard no expert evidence, and was left unaware of tracy housels serious mental/medical problems. he suffers from hypoglycemia, a condition of severe blood sugar imbalance. since the trial, an expert in this area has concluded that tracy housel had undergone an acute state of hypoglycemia, exacerbated by alcohol, at the time of the crime, and that he would not have been able to distinguish right from wrong, to control his behavior, or to form the intent necessary for first-degree murder. in addition, two mental health experts have concluded that tracy housel suffers from brain damage and psychological impairment, which combined with his drug and alcohol abuse, substantially impaired housels ability to recognize the criminality of his conduct. the state has introduced no conflicting expert testimony to rebut this evidence, which could have been used to present a defense of temporary insanity. instead, his inexperienced lawyer allowed housel to plead guilty to capital murder. meanwhile, the centerpiece of the prosecutions case for execution was evidence that tracy housel had allegedly committed three other crimes in other states, including a murder in texas, during a six-week period before jeanne drews murder. the state was allowed to present the evidence of these crimes, for which housel had neither been charged nor convicted, without having to prove that housel had committed them. in 2001, in another case, the inter-american commission on human rights (iachr) found that the use of such evidence at a capital sentencing violated the usas international obligations, and called on the us authorities to act, in particular by prohibiting the introduction of evidence of unadjudicated crimes during the sentencing phase of capital trials. on 27 february, the iachr issued precautionary measures calling for tracy housels execution to be stayed until it has ruled on the case. in the us courts, tracy housels appeal lawyers have argued that the constitutional requirement of reliability in death sentencing must prohibit the jury from weighing such evidence in its sentencing decision until it has found, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant committed them. the us court of appeals for the 11th circuit rejected this claim in 2001, despite writing that perhaps [the us] jurisprudence has evolved to recognize the right that housel espouses . concern over the introduction of this evidence in tracy housels case is heightened by the fact that the evidence of his involvement in the crimes was questionable. for example, in the case of the texas murder, the primary evidence was a statement made by tracy housel while he was held in coercive conditions during pre-trial detention in the local jail. he was not allowed to take a shower in the first three months of his incarceration, and was held in solitary confinement throughout this time. on several occasions, he was subjected to electro-shocks from a stun gun, including when standing in a pool of water. he also displayed serious mental health problems during this period. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible, in your own words: -

will you please blow my head off; and im an fbi agent. at the hearing, a former chief mental health officer with the texas prison system said that his review of the prison records and his own contact with monty delk suggested that the prisoner suffered from a severe mental illness. three years earlier, the prison diagnosis of monty delk had been changed to one of malingering - that he was feigning mental illness to avoid execution. this followed an alleged statement to this effect made by delk to another inmate and overheard by a prison staff member. in 1999 when the states death row was transferred from huntsville to livingston, medical staff at the new unit diagnosed delk with bipolar disorder. however, after they were made aware of the 1994 re-diagnosis, the official position once again became that his mental illness was a pretence. monty delks current lawyer has represented him since 1996. he says that he has been unable to have any rational communication with his client in that time. for example, when he visited him in december 2001, monty delk did not acknowledge his presence, or provide any useful information. he apparently continued to believe that he was in the military and that he was in control of a large and powerful organization. monty delks lawyer is seeking a hearing on the question of his clients competency for execution under a texas law enacted in 1999. the prosecutions position is that the execution should go forward as scheduled on the basis that he was found competent to continue his appeals in 1997. background information the execution of the insane - those who do not understand the reason for or reality of their punishment - is prohibited under a 1986 us supreme court ruling, ford v. wainwright . nevertheless, the minimal standards that pertain to competency determinations have meant that numerous individuals have been executed despite lingering doubts about whether they truly understood what was happening to them and why. the united nations safeguards guaranteeing protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty prohibit the execution of persons who have become insane. in resolutions in recent years, the un commission on human rights has repeatedly called on retentionist countries not to impose or carry out the death penalty on any person suffering from any form of mental disorder. while the extent of monty delks mental health problems remains in dispute, what is clear is that the death penalty against anyone contradicts emerging global standards of decency and justice, with 109 countries now abolitionist in law or practice, and the vast majority of executions carried out in a small number of countries, including china, iran, saudi arabia and the united states of america. since the usa resumed executions in 1977, 759 men and women have been put to death, more than 600 of them since 1990. texas accounts for a third of us executions, having lethally injected 260 people. ten men have been executed in the usa so far in 2002, four of them in texas. amnesty international opposes the death penalty unreservedly. it is a symptom of a culture of violence, not a solution to it. it tends to be applied in an arbitrary and discriminatory manner, it can never be free of the risk of irrevocable error, and it is inescapably cruel, both to the condemned and to their families. it is a government policy that encourages feelings of hatred and vengeance, and diverts resources and energies from constructive efforts to combat violent crime and to assist those who suffer the appalling trauma of losing a relative to murder. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: - expressing sympathy for the family and friends of gene olan allen;

also alleged in this case - have included inadequate defence representation, withholding of exculpatory evidence by the state, and the use of unreliable evidence. although the organization believes that dna testing cannot rid the death penalty of the risk of irrevocable error, it recognizes the potential of such testing to exonerate wrongfully convicted prisoners in the limited number of cases where dna evidence is left at the scene of a crime. windell broussards lawyers are seeking a 180-day stay of execution so that blood stains from the crime scene and fingernail scrapings taken from dianna harris broussard can be dna tested. amnesty international supports this move, while also appealing for the execution to be halted permanently. background information amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases. it is a cruel and brutalizing punishment which offers no constructive contribution to societys efforts to combat crime. since the usa resumed executions in 1977, it has put 752 men and women to death, more than 600 of them since 1990. texas accounts for a third of the countrys executions. see: usa: arbitrary, discriminatory and cruel: an aide-mmoire to 25 years of judicial killing (amr 51/003/2002, 17 january 2002). since 1973, 99 people have been released from death row in the usa after evidence of their innocence emerged. others have been put to death despite serious doubts about their guilt. such executions violate the united nations safeguards guaranteeing protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty which state: capital punishment may be imposed only when the guilt of the person charged is based upon clear and convincing evidence leaving no room for an alternative explanation of the facts. as the concern in the usa over the large number of wrongful convictions in capital cases has grown, particular attention has fallen on the potential for dna testing techniques to exonerate or incriminate. several states have enacted legislation providing for dna testing in criminal cases. during its 2001 session, the texas legislature passed a bill, signed into law by governor perry, requiring the state to preserve all biological evidence in criminal cases and providing for post-conviction dna testing. dna testing is undoubtedly an important forensic tool, and is to be supported. however, it provides no guarantee that irrevocable errors will be eliminated in capital cases. only a relatively small number of murder cases produce any dna evidence. of the 99 people released from death rows since 1973, only 11 were found to be innocent on the basis of dna testing. like any forensic techniques, dna testing is vulnerable to human fallibility or misconduct. in the case of charlie alston in north carolina, for example, the state lost potentially exonerating dna evidence. the governor commuted his death sentence earlier this month hours before it was due to be carried out. odell barnes was executed in texas in 2000. among the most incriminating evidence against him was blood found on his clothing, identified by dna testing as the victims. post-conviction investigation found that the blood contained a preservative using in the storing of blood, such as in laboratories. an expert concluded from the level of preservative that the blood did not come directly from the victim, but was deposited on the clothing after the crime. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible, in your own words: -

what is it? it is literally two lives, two human lives for the price of one because a person only has one life. if he is sentenced to life imprisonment on the first murder and you give him life on the second, is that appropriate punishment?... why do we even go through the effort of trying this case...? when the federal us court of appeals for the 11th circuit upheld ronald spiveys death sentence in 2000, one of the three judges dissented, saying that he should receive a new sentencing: spivey was prejudiced here because the prosecutor presented the jury with a false choice between imposing death and imposing no punishment. not only did the jury consider a conviction that has since been vacated, but the prosecutor presented the vacated life sentence not simply as a factor to consider, but as the decisive factor in urging the jury to recommend a death sentence. ronald spivey suffered a childhood of emotional and physical abuse and has a history of psychiatric problems. as a child, he was allegedly abused by his father, who would beat him, lock him in cupboards, and threaten to kill him. the boy fled home on numerous occasions, only to be returned by the authorities. at school, it was recognized that he had severe emotional problems, and he began receiving mental health treatment at the age of 12. however, his father frequently prevented him from receiving the psychiatric care he needed, apparently believing that beating him was more appropriate. ronald spivey is reported to be very remorseful for the shooting of billy watson. ronald spivey, who is said to have possibly the highest iq of any death row prisoner in the usa (around 170) has written: america is killing the economically deprived, those of the lower socioeconomic strata, killing the insane, killing the retarded, killing illiterates, killing the emotionally crippled, killing the socially disenfranchised and the politically powerless of our society, killing those so criminally abused as children that they never had a chance to develop normally to a well-balanced human being. ronald spivey was granted a stay of execution in march 2001, four hours before he was due to be executed in the electric chair. officials were reportedly about to begin shaving his head and leg to attach the electrodes when the stay was granted. the stay was a result of the georgia supreme courts ongoing consideration of the constitutionality of the electric chair. in october, it ruled against the use of the chair as a method of execution, opening the way for executions by lethal injection in georgia. in the last few weeks of 2001, four prisoners were executed in the state by that method. ronald spivey is scheduled to become the fifth. the usa has executed 752 men and women since resuming judicial killing in 1977, a period which has seen more than 60 countries legislate against the death penalty (see usa: arbitrary, discriminatory and cruel: an aide-mmoire to 25 years of judicial killing, amr 51/003/2002, 17 january 2002). further recommended action: please send faxes/express/airmail letters, in your own words, using any of the information from above or general arguments against the death penalty: - expressing sympathy for the relatives and friends of billy watson; - opposing the execution of ronald spivey, who has been on death row for almost a quarter of a century; - noting his remorse for the crime; - calling for clemency for ronald spivey. appeals to: the state board of pardons and paroles floyd veterans memorial building balcony level, east tower 2 martin luther king, jr. drive, s.e. atlanta, georgia 30334",1,"ronald spivey"

that family members of elizabeth lyman believe a life sentence is adequate; and that some jurors felt pressured into voting for death by other jurors. at his trial and re-sentencing, stephen anderson was represented by the same lawyer. the latter defended two other capital clients in san bernardino county between 1981 and 1986. in each case, the appeal courts found that his representation had fallen below the standard required by the constitution. the courts described the lawyers conduct, among other things, as  deplorable. stephen andersons death sentence has been allowed to stand, despite evidence that the lawyers representation of him was similarly inadequate - for example, he presented only one mitigation witness at the 1986 re-sentencing, a retired prison minister whose only meeting with anderson had taken place the day before. the lawyer failed to investigate or present to the jury compelling details of the physical abuse and neglect stephen anderson suffered during his childhood and of his other traumatic life experiences, including those he suffered while in prison in new mexico as a 21-year-old. in 2000, a three-judge panel of the ninth circuit court of appeals upheld the death sentence by two votes to one. last month, six ninth circuit judges dissented against the majoritys refusal to conduct a rehearing in front of the full court (en banc ): at a time when much of the civilized world is questioning the fairness of our application of the death penalty...it is regrettable that this court refuses to consider en banc the case of an individual sentenced to death...after being represented by a court-appointed attorney whom we have now twice deemed constitutionally ineffective in capital cases -- an attorney who has demonstrated a willingness to lie to the court and to betray the interests of his capital clients. the dissenters said that andersons death sentence may well have been imposed, not because of the crime that he committed, but because of the incompetence of an attorney with little integrity and a pattern of ineffective performance in capital cases, noting evidence from the other two cases that the lawyer had been deceptive, untrustworthy, and disloyal to his capital clients. of one client he had reportedly said that he did not care what happened to him, and of the other that he deserves to fry. the dissent concluded: ...we must at least ensure that the process we afford to individuals whose lives we propose to take is both fair and consistent with fundamental constitutional values. if the courts appoint incompetent counsel to handle a capital case, we should not then compound that judicial error by permitting the state to execute the ill-represented defendant. the system has now failed doubly in stephen andersons case. background information amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases. those who lose relatives to murder deserve compassion and respect, but a retributive execution is not such a response. it simply extends the suffering to the family and friends of the condemned, who for years anticipate the killing of their loved one. the loss which stephen andersons execution will inflict upon his mother, brother and two sons has been brought to the attention of the governor as part of the clemency petition. the death penalty also denies the possibility of rehabilitation. stephen anderson, for example, has become an award-winning artist and poet on death row. his writings have been published in various media, and his play, lament from death row, was performed in new york in 1991. in contrast to the 109 countries which have abolished the death penalty in law or practice, the usa has put 752 prisoners to death since it resumed executions in 1977. for further information, see: usa: arbitrary, discriminatory and cruel: an aide-mmoire to 25 years of judicial killing (amr 51/003/2002, 17 january), issued to mark the 25 th anniversary of the execution of gary gilmore. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible, in your own words: - expressing sympathy for the family and friends of elizabeth lyman, explaining that you are not seeking to minimize the suffering her death will have caused;

missouri on 9 january 2002. he was sentenced to death in 1993 for the murder of three police officers and the wife of another officer in december 1991. moniteau county deputy sheriff les roark was shot at jim johnsons home after he arrived to investigate a domestic disturbance. johnson then drove to the home of the sheriff where a christmas party was in progress. he opened fire, killing the sheriffs wife, pam jones. he drove to the home of deputy sheriff russell borts and shot him through the window. deputy borts survived. johnson then went to the sheriffs office, where there were officers from a number of jurisdictions. cooper county sheriff charles smith was shot dead as he came out of the building. miller county deputy sandra wilson was shot and killed a few moments later. at his trial, jim johnson pleaded not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect. the defense position was that he suffered post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd) as a result of his wartime experiences in vietnam, and that he had experienced vietnam-related flashbacks on the night of the murders which made him believe that he was confronted by the enemy and rendered him incapable of appreciating the wrongfulness of his conduct. in his opening statement, the defense lawyer drew attention to a perimeter of rope and tin cans set up around johnsons property, a foil wrapper in the garage, and the flattened tires on his car. he theorized that johnson, as in wartime, had set up the tin-can-rope perimeter to warn him of anyone approaching, that he ate a baked potato which had been cooked in foil while preparing to go out on a military mission, and that he had disabled his vehicle by slashing the tires in order that the enemy could not use it. this defense quickly unraveled, and the lawyers lack of preparation was revealed, when the state called witnesses who said that police officers, while waiting for johnson to return from the shootings, had set up the rope perimeter, left the foil, and flattened the tires of the car to prevent johnson from using it. the prosecution capitalized on the defense lawyers error by asserting that it was just one illustration of the defendants lies behind his ptsd defense. three experts testified for the defense that johnson suffered from ptsd, but the jury convicted him on four counts of first-degree murder and sentenced him to death on all four counts. in 1998, the missouri supreme court upheld the conviction and death sentence, rejecting the claim that inadequate legal representation had undermined the fairness of the trial and the reliability of its outcome. one of the five judges dissented saying that johnson should receive a new trial. judge ronnie white wrote: defense counsels unprofessional failure to interview [the prosecution witnesses] led the defense to make demonstrably false claims in its opening statement, claims that utterly destroyed the credibility of the ptsd theory before the defense even presented any evidence... i find it reasonably likely that a jury that had not seen the defense destroy its own credibility on this issue would have been sufficiently receptive to the expert diagnosis of a mental disease or defect to permit a reasonable likelihood of a different result... while mr johnson may not, as the jury found, have met the legal definition of insanity, whatever drove mr johnson to go from being a law-abiding citizen to being a multiple killer was certainly something akin to madness. i am not convinced that the performance of his counsel did not rob mr johnson of any opportunity he might have had to convince the jury that he was not responsible for his actions. jim johnson is reported to be a model inmate who is respected by staff and inmates and serves as a christian spiritual leader in the prison. background information amnesty international opposes the death penalty unreservedly, and believes that it can make no constructive contribution to efforts to combat violent crime. more than 100 countries are abolitionist in law or practice. since the usa resumed executions in 1977, 749 people have been put to death, 53 of them in missouri. there have been 66 executions in 2001. international standards require that capital defendants have adequate legal assistance at all stages of proceedings. the un commission on human rights has adopted resolutions urging retentionist countries not to impose the death penalty on a person suffering from any form of mental disorder or to execute any such person. in 1999, judge ronnie white, the dissenting judge in johnsons unsuccessful appeal, was nominated by president clinton to be a federal judge. the us senate voted to reject the nomination. a republican party campaign against the nomination was led by missouri senator john ashcroft. he depicted white, the first african-american judge to sit on the missouri supreme court, as pro-criminal in part because of his perceived reluctance to support death sentences. yet judge white had affirmed the death sentence in 41 out of 59 capital cases that had come before him, and in 10 out the 18 cases in which he voted against the death sentence, he was in the company of a unanimous court. judge white remains on the missouri supreme court. john ashcroft has since become us attorney general. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible, in your own words: - expressing sympathy for the family and friends of the four murder victims in this case, and stressing that you do not seek to excuse the violent manner of their deaths; - expressing concern that the errors of jim johnsons lawyer dealt a severe blow to his defense of mental illness, raising doubts as to the reliability of the outcome of the case; - noting the

43 member countries with 800 million inhabitants - adopted a resolution calling into question the usas observer status with the council because of the usas continuing resort to the death penalty. in april, the usa was voted off the un commission on human rights. a former us assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights, and labor, described the vote as a wake-up call that the era of automatic global deference to us leadership on human rights is over. our belief in our global exceptionalism has too often led us to vote alone at the commission, falsely assuming that such isolationism has no costs. among the issues he cited was the usas continuing refusal to support resolutions calling for a worldwide moratorium on the death penalty. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible. please write in your own words, using the following points if you wish: - expressing sympathy for the victims of violent crime, and their families; - expressing the view that the death penalty contributes nothing constructive to societys efforts to combat violence, and simply creates more grief and suffering -

abolished in law or practice by a majority of countries - that is a symptom of violence rather than a solution to it. in contrast to the global abolitionist trend, the usa has executed more than 600 people since 1990, including 58 this year, two of them in georgia in the past two weeks. supposedly reserved for the worst of the worst crimes and offenders, the us death penalty could more accurately be said to be reserved for the poor, the emotionally scarred, the mentally impaired, and the inadequately represented, with racial discrimination and prosecutorial discretion also influencing which of the thousands of murders committed each year will result in an execution. between 1976 and 1996, for example, nearly 52,000 men and women were murdered by people with whom they shared an intimate relationship, such as spouses or ex-spouses. few resulted in the state pursuing the death penalty. it seems that, in fred gilreaths case, the trial judge and the prosecutor both believed that this apparently unplanned alcohol-fuelled crime did not deserve the death penalty either. us politicians have frequently expressed their support for the death penalty in terms of victims rights, suggesting that a state-sanctioned retributive killing can somehow achieve emotional closure to the pain suffered by the relatives of murder victims. the same politicians will routinely overlook that the state is itself engaged in creating more grief and suffering, that of the loved ones of the condemned (see usa: state cruelty to families, amr 51/132/2001, 4 september 2001). recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible, in your own words: -

that her parents fought with themselves, friends and other family, and that there was never any love shown in our home. she indicated that her father was a drug addict, who stole to feed his addiction, and did god awful things in front of us. she has stated that emerson and the other siblings were beaten with extension cords and water hoses. emerson rudds cousin has also signed an affidavit testifying to the physical and mental abuse that emerson was subjected to from an early age. the death of emerson rudds elder brother in front of him is said to have been particularly traumatic. the appeal courts have rejected claims that emerson rudds trial lawyer was ineffective for not having presented to the jury the full details of his young clients abusive upbringing. the courts have responded that some of this information was presented, and that any more would simply have been cumulative and would not necessarily have changed the jurys sentencing decision. the courts have also rejected the appeal lawyers efforts to review the states file on the case to determine if there is any exculpatory evidence in it. emerson rudds lawyer is asking governor rick perry to grant a 30-day reprieve, pending resolution of the issue of payments to lawyers for their work preparing clemency petitions to the texas board of pardons and paroles. earlier in october, he filed a motion in a federal district court seeking either pre-payment of funds to prepare a clemency petition for emerson rudd or a stay of execution, pending a decision by another federal court in a separate case where this issue has been raised. the lawyer has stated that he has been financially unable to file a clemency petition on behalf of emerson rudd. the deadline for filing such a petition with the board has now passed. background information amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases. it is a punishment that is a symptom of, not a solution to, a culture of violence. more than 100 countries have abolished the death penalty in law or practice. in contrast, the usa continues its relentless resort to an outdated punishment which is an affront to human dignity and denies the human capacity for rehabilitation and reconciliation. the us capital justice system is characterized by arbitrariness, discrimination and error, as well as the inevitable cruelty. who is sentenced to death is as much influenced by the quality of defence representation, the discretionary power of prosecutors, and the race and economic status of the murder victim or defendant, as it is on the heinousness of the original crime. there have been 56 executions in the usa this year, bringing to 739 the number of prisoners put to death in the country since 1977. texas accounts for 253 of these executions, 14 of which have taken place this year. the last person executed in texas was gerald mitchell, who was 17 years old at the time of the crime. his execution violated the international legal ban on the use of the death penalty for crimes committed by under 18-year-olds. emerson rudd was less than a month past 18 at the time of the crime. while this places his case outside the international legal prohibition, the principle that lies behind that ban - namely the recognition of a young persons immaturity and capacity for change - demands consideration and compassion from the clemency authorities. in texas, the governor can commute a death sentence if the board of pardons and paroles recommends that he or she does so. the governor also has the power to grant a 30-day reprieve. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible, in your own words: - expressing sympathy for the family and friends of steve morgan;

- expressing concern that rapides parish is intending to seek a death sentence against joseph ward, in violation of the international prohibition on the death penalty against those were under 18 at the time of the crime; - pointing out the usas virtual isolation on this issue internationally, and the consequent damage to its international reputation; - explaining that the prohibition stems from the recognition of a young persons immaturity and capacity for rehabilitation, noting allegations that the state of louisiana earlier failed to provide rehabilitative and protective care to joseph ward in tallulah correctional center for youth;

if all 94 had pursued their appeals, at least some would likely have been successful, given the rate of error found in capital cases by appeal courts. there may be any number of factors contributing to an inmates decision not to pursue appeals, including mental disorder, physical illness, remorse, religious belief, the severity of death row conditions, the bleak alternative of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, pessimism about appeal prospects, a quest for notoriety, or simply to gain a semblance of control over a situation in which the inmate is otherwise helpless. but rational or irrational, a decision taken by someone under threat of death at the hands of others cannot be regarded as consensual. what is more, it cannot disguise the fact that the state is involved in a premeditated killing, a human rights violation that is a symptom of a culture of violence, not a solution to it (see the illusion of control: consensual executions, the impending death of timothy mcveigh, and the brutalizing futility of capital punishment , amr 51/053/2001, april 2001). after terry clark dropped his appeals in 1999, two officials from the state department of corrections witnessed a texas execution as part of its preparations to resume executions. this time new mexico has, at the cost of several thousand dollars, hired two executioners from the texas prison system to carry out terry clarks lethal injection on a freelance basis. when the state supreme court upheld clarks death sentence in 1999, one of the judges wrote that he was opposed philosophically and practically to the death penalty. i personally believe it to be a bad public policy. however, public policy is solely within the legislatures domain.... on 10 february 2001, a bill to repeal the death penalty in new mexico was defeated by one vote in the state senate. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible: - expressing sympathy for the family of dena lynn gore; - in your own words, using the above information as you see fit, voicing opposition to the death penalty and to the execution of terry clark; - urging the governor to offer leadership in line with the aspirations of the international community and not to allow his state to take the backward step of resuming executions after over four decades without them; -

every execution is a symptom of, not a solution to, a culture of violence. killing prisoners offers no constructive contribution to society's efforts to combat violent crime. international standards require that capital defendants be provided with 'adequate assistance of counsel at every stage of proceedings, above and beyond the protection afforded in non-capital cases.' on 2 august, the north carolina supreme court rejected the claim brought by various death row inmates that governor easley cannot be an impartial arbiter of clemency petitions because of his former role as the state's attorney general, and, before that, as a local prosecutor. the decision had been expected on 17 august (extra 46/01, 2 august). recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible, in your own words: - expressing sympathy for the family and friends of ralph childress;

the three perpetrators stole one of the luttigs mercedes benz cars. amnesty international does not know if smith county ever considered seeking the death penalty in the holland murder, but it may have been unable to do so if there were no aggravating factors under state law - such as robbery or kidnaping - making the crime  death-eligible. napoleon beazleys lawyer has noted to amnesty international the fact that even today in texas, a black man can be executed for a murder of a white man while stealing his property, yet a white man cannot be executed for murdering a black man because he was black. in texas, the jury has to decide that the defendant will pose a future threat to society if allowed to live. there was little support for this in napoleon beazleys case. he had no criminal record and no record of violent behaviour. a stream of witnesses described a helpful, respectful teenager, whose involvement in the luttig killing was out of character. the state relied upon his two co-defendants testimony - much of which they have since admitted was false and was given in return for a prosecution promise not to pursue the death penalty against them - to paint a picture of a violent and remorseless individual. they now say he was remorseful to the point of being suicidal after the crime. among those appealing for clemency is the district attorney of napoleon beazleys home county, houston county. in her appeals, she writes: i have been a strong advocate for the death penalty my entire adult life... based on my knowledge of napoleon beazley as a person, as well as my knowledge of the facts of his criminal offense, i would not have sought the death penalty had this case been filed in houston county... bottom line, mr beazley is a young, black man from a small community who could have done great things in his life because he was charming, smart, respectful and a genuinely good kid. he was a fool to be influenced by his co-defendants and a fool to act like a common street thug in this one instance. he made a terrible mistake this one time, but i hope you will consider his background, his remorse for the sorrow he has brought to the victims family as well as his own and the fact this is an isolated incident and commute his sentence to life in prison. international law forbids the execution of those who were under 18 at the time of the crime in recognition of their immaturity, impulsiveness, vulnerability to peer pressure, and capacity for change. see too young to vote, old enough to be executed -

james froemsdorf was white. all the proposed counties had some african american residents. the judge selected schuyler county in the north of the state, which neither side had suggested, and which had no black residents at the time (compared to about seven per cent in perry county and around 10 per cent statewide). in addition, prior to being assigned to the case, the judge had presented a plaque to the state highway patrol, bearing a message composed by the judge under a pseudonym, in memory of trooper froemsdorf. the judge rejected a defense motion that he should withdraw from the case on account of this. the trial took place in lancaster, a rural community with a population of less than 1,000. many members of the state highway patrol attended, including 11 of its 12 highest-ranking officers. pretrial publicity and security measures during the proceedings were extensive, arguably creating an atmosphere highly prejudicial to the defendant. the all-white jury convicted jerome mallett of first-degree murder and sentenced him to death. during post-conviction proceedings, another judge assigned to examine the trial judges actions said that mallett must receive a new trial. he ruled that the transfer decision, by denying the defendant any chance to have members of his own race on the jury, had given rise to the appearance of having been racially motivated. however, the missouri supreme court set aside his ruling, and this was upheld by the us supreme court. three us supreme court justices dissented, saying that the case gave rise to a prima facie showing of racial discrimination, in violation of jerome malletts fundamental right to equal protection before the law. in subsequent appeals against the conviction and sentence, three of the seven missouri supreme court judges dissented from the courts decision to uphold the death sentence. given the circumstances of the case, they said that malletts sentence was disproportionate and should be reduced to life imprisonment. the dissent pointed to the impulsive nature of the froemsdorf murder and compared it to the case of david tate, a white supremacist involved in preparing an armed rebellion against the us and missouri governments, who was convicted of killing a missouri trooper in april 1985. after he was stopped in a van transporting a number of automatic weapons and hand grenades, tate shot the trooper 11 times and also seriously injured another officer. he received a life sentence. background information the history of the us death penalty is one of racist use, and to this day race remains an element in the application of this punishment. in 1994, a us supreme court justice said: even under the most sophisticated death penalty statutes, race continues to play a major role in determining who shall live and who shall die. research over the past two decades has consistently shown a pattern of sentencing anomalies which cannot be explained without reference to racial factors, particularly in relation to the race of the murder victim. in 1990, the general accounting office (an independent agency of the us government) issued a report on death penalty sentencing patterns. after reviewing and evaluating 28 major studies, the report concluded that 82 per cent of the surveys found a correlation between the race of the victim and the likelihood of a death sentence. the finding was remarkably consistent across data sets, states, data collection methods and analytic techniques. . .[t]he race of victim effect was found at all stages of the criminal justice system process.... the population of the usa is about 75 per cent white and 12 per cent black. since 1976, blacks have been six to seven times more likely to be murdered than whites, with the result that blacks and whites are the victims of murder in about equal numbers. as of 20 june 2001, 720 people had been put to death in the usa since executions resumed in 1977. in over 80 per cent of the cases, the crimes involved white victims. missouri has executed 50 prisoners. in 38 cases (76 per cent) the murder victims were white. recommended action: please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible, in your own words: - expressing sympathy for the friends and family of james froemsdorf, explaining that you are not seeking to condone the manner of his death;

a symptom of schizophrenia - from as early as 1992. his disturbed behaviour over the years has included setting fire to his cell, banging his head against the wall, screaming incoherently, and fouling his food and then eating it. during recent psychotic episodes, he was taken out of his cell and placed on 24-hour suicide watch. he has been given anti-psychotic drugs. jay scott was scheduled to be killed on 17 april 2001. the governor denied clemency, but the ohio supreme court blocked the execution about an hour before it was due to be carried out in order to give a lower court more time to consider the issue of his mental illness. on 20 april, that court ruled that scott, while unquestionably ill, was competent to be executed, that is that he understood the reality of and reason for his punishment. the court further ruled that it was not unconstitutional to execute the mentally ill. scotts execution was set for 15 may. again, minutes before it was due to be carried out, the federal sixth circuit court of appeals stopped the execution in order for the court to consider whether to reopen the case. catheters had already been put in jay scotts arms in preparation for the lethal injection. on 30 may, the sixth circuit lifted the stay. the lawyers sought to delay the setting of another execution date, but on the evening of 7 june, a new date of 14 june was set. the state is not disputing that scott is mentally ill, but maintains that he is competent and can therefore be executed. its position contradicts repeated resolutions at the un commission on human rights urging countries which still use the death penalty not to impose it on a person suffering from any form of mental disorder or to execute any such person. the latest such resolution was adopted in april. the us national alliance for the mentally ill believes that the death penalty is never appropriate for a defendant suffering from schizophrenia or other serious brain disorders. jay scotts background is one of poverty, deprivation and exposure to violence from an early age. at his 1984 trial, his lawyers decided not to present any mitigating evidence to this effect because they feared it would reveal details of his criminal history. their decision meant that the jury was left unaware of factors which had helped to shape jay scotts life. according to his current lawyers, jay scott was the sixth of 11 children born to parents who married when they were both 14 years old because the mother was pregnant. because the father spent the familys money on alcohol and gambling, the mother used to ask neighbours for food or allow the children to steal food if they were hungry. the father was physically and emotionally abusive to his wife and children, particularly when he was drunk. he would beat them, and on one occasion he stabbed his wife, who had to be hospitalised. jay and his brothers ran into trouble with the law from an early age, and were all convicted of juvenile offences. jay was first incarcerated when he was nine because of truancy problems. he was in and out of juvenile detention through his teen years and served several years in prison as an adult. the rest of the familys story is a litany of tragedy. one brother was shot dead, and another was paralysed from the neck down as a result of gunshot wounds. another brother suffered mental illness and has spent much of his life in psychiatric hospitals. jay scotts eldest sister died in a house fire before he was born. another sister was shot to death during an argument. a third killed a brother-in-law in self-defence. in april 2000, the federal sixth circuit court of appeals wrote that the mitigating evidence which had been withheld from the jury would have revealed scotts personal loyalty to his siblings, girlfriend, and children, and an exceedingly violent environment throughout his upbringing...[i]t is impossible to say for certain that one juror would not have been swayed by this evidence [juror unanimity was required for a death sentence], but certainty is not what is required here; we must ask only whether scott has met his burden of demonstrating a reasonable probability that this would happen...scott can only offer a hypothetical juror, not a reasonable probability, and hence cannot show prejudice. further recommended action: please telephone or send telegrams/faxes/emails in your own words using the following guide: - expressing sympathy for the relatives and friends of vinnie prince and explaining that you do not wish to condone the manner of her death; - expressing concern that ohio is preparing to execute a man who suffers from serious mental illness; -

(see update to extra 85/00, 11 december 2000). the justice departments statistics are of direct relevance to juan garzas case, given his ethnic origin and the fact that he was prosecuted in texas, one of the handful of states accounting for the vast majority of cases in which federal prosecutors have sought the death penalty. the statistics suggest that the same crime committed by a different person in a different state may have resulted in a sentence of less than death. there are numerous examples in which the death penalty was not sought against federal defendants accused of killing several victims in drug-related murders. the onus is on the government to prove that neither bias nor discrimination plays any role in federal capital justice. yet with juan garza less than a month from execution, the justice department has not released any further analysis. there are indications that the department may release further information a matter of days before juan garzas execution. background information juan garza is one of two federal inmates scheduled for execution. the other is timothy mcveigh, who is currently considering whether to resume appeals following revelations that the fbi withheld evidence in his case (see update to extra 25/01, 22 may 2001). while there have been 713 state-level executions in the usa since it resumed judicial killing in 1977, there have been no executions of federal prisoners since 1963. as the usa prepares to end a 38-year de facto moratorium on federal executions, much of the rest of the world has turned against this cruel and irrevocable punishment, with 108 countries abolitionist in law or practice. this is also a time of unprecedented domestic concern about the reliability and fairness of us capital justice in light of overwhelming evidence that its hallmarks are discrimination, arbitrariness and error. this is an issue crying out for leadership at the highest level. amnesty international has been calling on president bush, who promised at his inauguration to be a leader who would speak for greater justice and compassion, to announce a moratorium on federal executions as a first step towards leading his country away from this failed and outdated policy. recommended action: please send telegrams/faxes/express/ letters in your own words, using the following guide: - expressing sympathy for the victims of violent crime and their families; - urging that the us government comply with the recommendations of the inter-american commission on human rights, stating that to proceed with juan garzas execution in the light of the iachr ruling would be to further seriously damage the usas international reputation; - expressing concern that only weeks from juan garzas execution, no official analysis of the racial and geographic disparities in the federal death penalty has been released, noting that such analysis bears direct relevance to this case; - arguing that no one can have any confidence that the decision to seek the death sentence against juan garza was not influenced by his ethnicity or the state where the prosecution took place; - expressing deep concern that the federal government is planning to resume executions after nearly four decades, out of step with world abolitionist trends and growing domestic concern about the death penalty; - calling on the president to commute juan garzas death sentence and to declare a moratorium on federal executions. appeals to: president george w. bush the white house office of the president 1600 pennsylvania avenue washington, dc 20500, usa",0,"juan garza*"

for those who have long worked against the death penalty in the usa, the revelations have come as no surprise. the reality is that official misconduct, legal incompetence, political expediency, discrimination, arbitrariness, and error have been the hallmarks of the us capital justice system over the past two decades. a recent indication that the federal death penalty system is plagued by the same lottery-like qualities as its state level counterparts came in september 2000, when the us justice department released the findings of a review into the federal capital justice system. these revealed widespread racial and geographic disparities in the application of the federal death penalty (see memorandum to president clinton: an appeal for human rights leadership as the first federal execution looms , november 2000). these findings led president clinton to issue a six-month stay of execution for juan raul garza, who was due to die by lethal injection on 12 december 2000, and who is now scheduled to die on 19 june, eight days after timothy mcveigh. as one of his last acts in office, president clinton also commuted the death sentence of a federal prisoner, david ronald chandler, whose guilt was in serious doubt (see extra 03/01, 12 january 2001 and update). more than 60 countries have abolished the death penalty since the usa resumed executions in 1977. today, as the first us federal execution in almost four decades approaches, more than 100 countries have abandoned executions in law or practice. a measure of the global progress towards abolition can also be found in the mandate of the international criminal court. set up to try the worlds worst crimes - genocide, torture, mass killing - the most severe penalty that the court will be able to impose is life imprisonment, subject to review after 25 years. amnesty international opposes executions in all cases, without reservation, regardless of the heinousness of the crime. the death penalty is a symptom of a culture of violence, not a solution to it. by imitating what it seeks to condemn - the deliberate taking of human life - the state is allowing those who kill to set societys moral tone. the death penalty offers no answers to the many questions that arise from violent crime, and diverts energy and resources away from humane, constructive alternatives to confronting this pressing social problem. it encourages feelings of vengeance, division, intolerance, and hatred. it is an entirely destructive exercise with no measurable societal benefit. the usas increasingly isolated resort to this cruel, brutalizing, ineffective and irrevocable punishment is a matter that cries out for leadership at the highest level. president bush can declare a moratorium on federal executions under article ii, section 2, clause 1, of the us constitution, which gives him the power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the united states. further recommended action: please send telegrams/faxes/express letters, in your own words, drawing from the above and other arguments as you see fit. while expressing sympathy for the victims of violent crime, urge president bush not to allow federal executions to resume after 38 years without them and to impose an immediate moratorium with a view to leading his country away from the death penalty. appeals to: george w. bush the president the white house office of the president 1600 pennsylvania avenue washington, dc 20500",0,"timothy mcveigh*"

we must ask only whether scott has met his burden of demonstrating a reasonable probability that this would happen...scott can only offer a hypothetical juror, not a reasonable probability, and hence cannot show prejudice. the power of executive clemency exists to compensate for the rigidity of the courts.  should the state allow the execution of jay scott to proceed it would simply be perpetuating a tragic cycle of violence. background information amnesty international opposes the death penalty under all circumstances. the usas capital justice system is marked by arbitrariness, discrimination and error. the poor and members of racial minorities are disproportionately represented on its death rows. as of 9 march 2001, there were 201 men on ohios death row, including 102 blacks and 92 whites. the states population at large is about 88 per cent white and 11 per cent black. since the usa resumed executions in 1977, 702 prisoners have been put to death in 31 states. ohio has carried out one execution since 1963, that of wilford berry on 19 february 1999. berry, who had a history of suicide attempts, a diagnosis of schizophrenia, and a childhood of extreme physical and sexual abuse, had given up his appeals. recommended action: please send faxes/express/letters in your own words: - expressing sympathy for the relatives and friends of vinnie prince and explaining that you do not wish to condone the manner of her death;

who has never denied the robbery - fled, shots were fired and lt oliver was killed by a single bullet. at the trial, the two police officers testified that they had not fired, but admitted that they had not seen workman shoot oliver.  an alleged eyewitness, harold davis, said that he had seen workman shoot the officer.  the defence lawyer conducted no forensic or ballistics analysis and did not investigate harold davis. since the trial, however, harold davis has retracted his testimony, saying he lied under police coercion.  an eyewitness has come forward to say that at least one of the other officers fired his gun.  ballistics experts have stated that the fatal bullet could not have come from workmans weapon, raising the possibility that lt oliver was killed by a shot fired by one of the other officers. five jurors from the original trial have signed affidavits that they would not have voted for a first-degree murder conviction, let alone the death sentence, if they had been presented with this evidence.  two state supreme court judges have suggested that clemency is merited in workmans case. in september 2000, the federal us court of appeals for the sixth circuit split 7-7 on whether to grant a hearing into the new evidence.  workman had needed one more vote. when the tennessee supreme court set the new execution date on 28 february 2001, one of the justices dissented.  justice birch believes that the court should make a formal recommendation to governor sundquist that workmans sentence be commuted because of two extenuating circumstances.  firstly, he believes that philip workmans death sentence is disproportionate and excessive: olivers death...was not brought about by any abnormally torturous or violent means compared to typical homicides.  the record reflects that the jury did not find that the murder was premeditated.  in addition, workmans criminal record as disclosed at trial does not include any prior violent crimes... in my view, when the facts and circumstances of this case are considered, they are far less egregious than the circumstances of most cases in which the tennessee supreme court has affirmed the sentence of death... indeed, the facts of this case are less egregious that the facts of many cases the court has reviewed in which a life sentence was imposed. secondly, justice birch wrote of the new evidence in the workman case: [i] t would not be improper to observe the uncontroverted fact that seven judges of the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit, including the chief judge, have concluded that workmans claims are sufficient to justify a formal hearing to more fully explore the merits of his claims.  moreover, it would not be improper to observe that, if true, workmans allegations would be particularly serious because the evidence he offers undermines the theory pursued by the prosecution at trial, and furthermore the evidence allegedly was beyond workmans reach at the time of his trial because of the actions of the prosecution [workmans appeal lawyers claim that the prosecution withheld x-ray evidence supportive of the contention that lt oliver was not killed by a bullet from workmans gun]... that workman may be executed without ever having been afforded an opportunity to prove his claims in an evidentiary hearing before any court should be deemed an extenuating circumstance which, in my view, justifies issuance of the certificate of commutation. the united nations safeguards guaranteeing protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty state: capital punishment may be imposed only when the guilt of the person charged is based upon clear and convincing evidence leaving no room for an alternative explanation of the facts. this is clearly a case where execution would violate this standard. in 2000, lt olivers daughter and the daughter of philip workman united at a press conference to appeal for the execution not to go ahead. further recommended action: please send e-mail/telegrams/faxes/express/ airmail letters in your own words, using the following guide: -

21 february 2001 usa (texas):    dennis thurl dowthitt, white, aged 55 dennis dowthitt is scheduled to be executed in texas on 7 march 2001. he was sentenced to death in 1992 for the murder of gracie purnhagen. the bodies of 16-year-old gracie purnhagen and her nine-year-old sister tiffany purnhagen were found on 16 june 1990 near a pipeline in montgomery county. the younger girl had been strangled. her older sister had been sexually assaulted, and her throat had been cut. dennis dowthitts 16-year-old son, delton dowthitt, who was dating gracie purnhagen at the time, confessed to police that he had killed both girls. he subsequently entered into a plea bargain, pleading guilty to the murder of tiffany purnhagen in exchange for a 45-year prison sentence and testimony against his father for the sexual assault and killing of gracie purnhagen. although dennis dowthitt admits giving his son a lift to the place where the girls were murdered, he has steadfastly maintained that he was not present at the actual crime, and that it was his son who killed both girls. amnesty international is not in a position to assess his guilt or innocence, and opposes his execution in any event. however, the organization is concerned by evidence that would either appear to support dennis dowthitts version of events, or call into question his sons trial testimony. for example, delton dowthitt has apparently told others, both before and after his fathers trial, that he, delton, killed both girls. a police report, which the jury did not see, reportedly indicates that delton dowthitt had previously raped a girl in the same place where the murders occurred. in addition, dennis dowthitts current lawyers have raised serious questions about the reliability of the forensic test results used by the state to implicate him in the murder. dennis dowthitt, who is now deaf, has suffered from mental illness since he was a teenager. his original trial lawyers did not investigate this issue, or the abuse he suffered as a child, to present in mitigation. one of several mental health experts, who have assessed dowthitt since his conviction, concluded that his profile was consistent with paranoid and schizophrenic features. a second expert has stated that the tapes of dennis dowthitts interrogation showed his severe mental problems. she also said that he functions quite peacefully and successfully within the prison environment, undermining the jurys finding of his likely future dangerousness, a prerequisite for the death sentence in texas. dennis dowthitt is reported to have been a model prisoner for the nine years he has been on death row. his only disciplinary write-up was for having hung a sheet in front of the toilet in his cell on 11 november 1997. dennis dowthitts current appeal lawyers continue to investigate aspects of this case, including questions surrounding the physical evidence relied upon by the state at the trial. in the event that the board of pardons and paroles does not recommend clemency, they will ask the governor of texas to issue a 60-day reprieve to allow them to continue their investigations. background information since the usa resumed judicial killing in 1977, 697 prisoners have been put to death. texas accounts for 243 (35%) of these executions, and has regularly breached international standards, including by using the death penalty against children, the mentally impaired, foreign nationals denied their consular rights, defendants whose representation was inadequate, and those whose guilt remained in doubt right up to their execution. there have been four executions in texas since lieutenant governor rick perry was sworn in as governor on 21 december 2000 after george w bush, the former texas governor, won the us presidency. there were 152 executions in texas during governor bushs five-year term in office. the widely held belief that the execution of the mentally impaired flouts basic standards of justice and decency is reflected in a resolution adopted in april 2000 by the un commission on human rights, urging all retentionist countries not to impose the death penalty on a person suffering from any form of mental disorder or to execute any such person. the un safeguards guaranteeing protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty states that: capital punishment may be imposed only when the guilt of the person charged is based upon clear and convincing evidence leaving no room for an alternative explanation of the facts. international standards also require that a person facing the death penalty be provided with adequate assistance of counsel at every stage of the proceedings, above and beyond the protection afforded in non-capital cases (un economic and social council, resolution 1989/64, 24 may 1989). amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases. every death sentence is an affront to human dignity; every execution is a symptom of a culture of violence, not a solution to it. recommended action: please send faxes/express/airmail letters, in your own words, using the following guidelines: - expressing sympathy for the family of gracie and tiffany purnhagen,

one was inattentive during jury selection; and one had studied psychology and sociology at college, and displayed a liberal attitude. the prosecutor was looking for conservative jurors. under us constitutional law jurors can only be removed for race neutral reasons (batson v kentucky, 1986). however, to win an appeal on this issue, the defendant must show that purposeful discrimination took place. amnesty international believes that the batson decision has failed to prevent racial bias in jury selection. proving purposeful discrimination is nearly impossible, since prosecutors need only present a vaguely plausible non-racial reason for dismissing potential jurors. willie fisher was represented by an attorney who was suffering from severe depression and other serious health problems, and who spent little time preparing for the trial. he did not present expert pharmacological testimony despite the defence being one of voluntary intoxication, that is that alcohol and drugs had rendered fisher incapable of forming the intent necessary for first-degree murder. he also failed to tell the jury of the important evidence that angela johnson herself had told the police that fishers conduct the evening before the murder had been unprecedented. during the time between fishers arrest and trial, the lawyer was sanctioned twice by the state bar for failing to properly represent clients. following fishers conviction, the lawyer asked to be removed from the case when it went to appeal, but the state supreme court rejected his request. a week after the lawyer argued fishers appeal to the court, the state bar suspended his licence for three years. in 2000 he was reportedly arrested and charged with various offences relating to his law practice. in the opinion of some mental health experts, fisher was in an alcohol and drug-induced black-out when he committed the murder, having consumed large quantities of alcohol and crack cocaine in the hours preceding the crime. he had begun drinking and using crack cocaine more heavily after the death of his mother six months earlier. his mother was an alcoholic, and as a child fisher had begun drinking with her as a way of keeping her at home and out of trouble. the youngest of nine children, fishers childhood was reportedly marked by poverty, his own substance abuse, his mothers drunkenness and violent arguments between his parents. he is reported to have been a model inmate, who has not been the subject of a single disciplinary report while on death row. background information a north carolina newspaper, the charlotte observer, carried out a six-month study of the death penalty in north and south carolina last year. it found that in too many cases defendants are represented by incompetent lawyers poorly prepared for trials. the paper also concluded that minority defendants start out with an intolerable and indefensible disadvantage compared to white defendants... black citizens are under-represented on juries. prosecutors often excuse potential black jurors because they are less likely to vote for a death penalty conviction. there is a strong moratorium movement in north carolina, and on 25 january the council of the small town of cary became the 12th local government in the state to pass a resolution calling for a moratorium on executions. a legislative commission studying the states death penalty has also voiced its support for a moratorium. it is recommending ending the use of the death penalty against people with mental retardation and taking measures to eliminate racial bias in the application of the death penalty. its legislative recommendations have yet to come before the legislature. fourteen prisoners have been executed in the usa this year, bringing to 697 the total number of executions since 1977. in north carolina, the governor has the exclusive authority to grant clemency. recommended action: please send faxes/express/airmail letters, in your own words, using the following guide: - expressing sympathy for the family and friends of angela johnson, and explaining that you do not seek to excuse her murder;

aged 26 antonio richardson is scheduled to be executed in missouri on 7 march 2001 in violation of international law, which prohibits the use of the death penalty against those who were under 18 at the time of the crime. he was convicted in 1993 of first-degree murder in the death of julie kerry and second-degree murder in the death of her sister, robin. on the night of 4 april 1991, julie and robin kerry, white, aged 21 and 19 respectively, and their cousin, thomas cummins, also aged 19, were on an abandoned bridge spanning the mississippi river near st louis, when they were confronted by reginald clemons, aged 20, marlin gray, aged 23, antonio richardson, aged 16, and 15-year-old daniel winfrey. the sisters were raped and pushed off the bridge into the river 25 metres below. cummins was forced to jump. he survived, but both sisters drowned. clemons and gray allegedly threatened to hurt anyone who did not cooperate in the crime or said anything about it afterwards. nevertheless, richardson contacted the police the next day and confessed his involvement in the crime, saying that he had not pushed the sisters off the bridge. daniel winfrey, white, testified against his three co-defendants in exchange for a prison sentence. then marlin gray and reginald clemons, both black, were sentenced to death at their trials and remain on death row. finally, antonio richardson, a mentally impaired teenager, rejected a prosecution offer of a life sentence in return for a guilty plea, against the advice of his lawyer. he was allegedly persuaded to do so by a local activist who, assigning racial motives to the prosecution, believed that richardson should go to trial to prove his innocence. under missouri law, a defendant involved in a murder does not have to have been the actual killer to be convicted of first-degree murder. the jury convicted antonio richardson, but were unable to agree on his punishment. in this situation, under missouri law, the judge became the sentencer, and condemned the teenager to death. neither judge nor jury heard any expert testimony about richardsons brain damage or mental disabilities. the defense had hired a neuropsychologist to testify about this, but richardsons lawyer, who had no experience of capital sentencing, decided not to present the witness for strategic reasons. when the jury deadlocked, the lawyer asked the judge to hear the expert testimony prior to determining punishment. the judge refused. antonio richardsons mental disability is well documented. when he was 13, his iq was measured at 70, placing him in the borderline mental retardation range. the assessment described him as learning disabled and easily lead by others. after his arrest, the expert hired by the defense found that richardson did not know the difference between an ocean and a lake, did not know the season that came after winter, did not know what made a sailboat move through the water, did not know simple nursery rhymes, did not know the country or even the state in which he lived... it is quite apparent from the test results that mr richardson is significantly compromised... in all complex mental activity. most noteworthy are severe impairments in attention and concentration, memory, learning..., speech and language skills, spatial and perceptual skills.... in 1993, antonio richardsons iq was assessed at 73, also within the borderline retardation range. in 1994, a psychologist found that the then 19-year-old richardson operated at the level of a seven-year-old in the area of communication and social skills, and functioned as a 12-year-old in the area of daily living skills. antonio richardsons childhood was marked by poverty and parental neglect. he never knew his father, and his mother had drug, alcohol, and health problems. by the age of 15, antonio richardson had himself developed drug and alcohol problems. background information in recognition of childrens immaturity and potential for rehabilitation, the international covenant on civil and political rights (iccpr) and the convention on the rights of the child (crc) forbid the execution of those who were under 18 at the time of the crime. while 191 countries have ratified the crc, only the usa and somalia have not. when the usa ratified the iccpr, it reserved the right to execute child offenders, a move widely condemned. the human rights committee, the body which oversees compliance with the iccpr, has called for the us reservation to be withdrawn. in 2000, the un sub-commission on the promotion and protection of human rights affirmed that the imposition of the death penalty on those aged under 18 at the time of the commission of the offence is contrary to customary international law. a principle of customary international law is one that is a general practice accepted as law and is binding on all countries, regardless of which treaties they have or have not ratified. the usa is the leading perpetrator of this violation of international law. since 1990, it has executed 14 child offenders out of a known world total of 26 in seven countries. since then, two of these countries, yemen and pakistan, have abolished this use of the death penalty (although some child offenders remain on death row in pakistan). the usa accounts for eight of the 11 executions of child offenders documented in the past three years; the three others were carried out in iran (2) and the democratic republic of congo (1). all the child offenders executed in the usa since 1977 were 17 at the time of the crime, except sean sellers who was 16. more than 80 people are on us death rows for crimes committed when they were 16 or 17. it is now over a decade since the un general assembly adopted a resolution recommending that retentionist countries abolish the death penalty for persons suffering from mental retardation or extremely limited mental competence. the american association on mental retardation, now in its 125th year, holds that the death penalty is disproportionate to the level of culpability possible for people with mental retardation. thirteen us states ban the use of the death penalty against defendants with mental retardation. missouri is currently considering such legislation. recommended action: please send faxes/express/airmail letters, in your own words, using the following guide: - expressing

a mental evaluation revealing borderline mental retardation, acute paranoid and depressive disorders; expression of remorse; and indications that lingar was a good candidate for rehabilitation. lingar was clearly prejudiced by his counsels failure to develop and present this evidence. there is no reasonable probability that a jury advised of these circumstances would have imposed the death sentence on this mentally retarded and mentally disturbed young man. background information the us death penalty is a lethal lottery; who is sentenced to death can depend on a wide range of factors beyond the heinousness of the crime, including the quality of legal representation afforded to the defendant. one of the primary sources of arbitrariness is the prosecutors discretion in choosing in which cases and against which defendants to pursue a death sentence. time and time again in crimes involving two defendants, one is offered a plea bargain in return for testimony against the other. there have frequently been serious questions about whether the relative culpability of the defendants was reflected in the eventual outcome. recommended action: please send telegrams/faxes/express/airmail letters, in your own words, using the following guide: - expressing sympathy for the family and friends of thomas scott allen, and explaining that you are not seeking to condone the manner of his death;

ruiz, salvadoran national, aged 41 jos amaya ruiz is due to be executed in arizona on 18 january 2001. he was sentenced to death in 1986 for the murder of kimberly lopez, who was killed at her home on 28 march 1985. amaya ruiz, an illegal immigrant from el salvador, was employed by lopez and her husband on their ranch near tucson. since 1985, jos amaya ruiz has been diagnosed as suffering from various mental illnesses, including bipolar disorder (manic depression) and paranoid schizophrenia. he suffers from auditory and visual hallucinations, delusions and paranoid ideation. he has been treated with anti-psychotic medication for more than a decade, although he has sometimes refused treatment, either because he believed that he was not ill or that the drugs were poison. in 1985, a psychologist for the state estimated amaya ruizs iq to be in the region of 65-75, indicating a learning disability. jos amaya ruiz has made numerous suicide attempts, both during pre-trial detention and since his conviction. he has also engaged in acts of self-mutilation with razor blades and other sharp objects. his behaviour has included banging his head, throwing urine and faeces, and spending weeks in his cell naked and surrounded by his own waste. in 1999, a prison doctor concluded that jos amaya ruiz understood neither the reason for, nor the reality of his death sentence, and was therefore legally insane and could not be executed. a second doctor, to whom jos amaya ruiz explained that they dont kill people here, they just treat them badly, also said that the prisoner was incompetent for execution. in 2000, jos amaya ruiz was moved to hospital and remained under mental health care. on 30 august, a doctor at the hospital determined that amaya ruiz was competent to be executed. on 17 november, he was transferred back to a special psychiatric unit on death row. amnesty international believes it violates medical ethics to treat a prisoner with a view to restoring competency for execution. american medical association policy states: when a condemned prisoner has been declared incompetent to be executed, physicians should not treat the prisoner for the purpose of restoring competence unless a commutation order is issued before treatment begins. jos amaya ruiz is one of about 90 foreign nationals on death row in the usa. as in the majority of these cases, jos amaya ruiz was not informed upon arrest of his right to contact his consulate for assistance. as such, the arresting authorities violated us obligations under international law in their failure to comply with the notification provisions of article 36 of the vienna convention on consular relations. jos amaya ruiz is believed to have first come to the usa in 1984, the year before his arrest. the extent of his exposure to the war and political violence in el salvador at the time he lived there is not known, both because his trial lawyer was unable to investigate this, and because his mental impairment renders him a poor reporter of his life history. two of his brothers were killed in the violence, and he has recalled burying the dead in his village with his hands because he had no spade. his own body bears the scars of bullet wounds, as yet unexplained. background information the united nations safeguards guaranteeing protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty, adopted in 1984, prohibit the execution of prisoners who have become insane. the us organization, the national alliance for the mentally ill, opposes the use of the death penalty against defendants with serious mental disorders. the widely held belief that the execution of the mentally impaired flouts basic standards of justice and decency is reflected in a resolution adopted on 26 april 2000 by the un commission on human rights, urging all retentionist countries not to impose the death penalty on a person suffering from any form of mental disorder or to execute any such person. it is nearly 12 years since the un adopted a resolution recommending that un member states eliminate the death penalty for persons suffering from mental retardation or extremely limited mental competence, whether at the stage of sentence or execution. in 1999, arizona executed two german nationals, karl and walter lagrand, who had not been advised of their consular rights, causing widespread international outrage. the german government took the case to the international court of justice (icj), which heard arguments from the german and us governments in november 2000. the icj has yet to rule on the case. the arizona governor can grant clemency if the clemency board recommends he or she do so, but can also ignore such a recommendation. in the case of walter lagrand, governor hull not only ignored

virginia - 80; and florida - 49). in his inaugural address on 17 january 1995, governor george w bush jr of texas said: we must make texas a beacon state. he claims to have achieved this aim and labels himself as a compassionate leader. nevertheless, since he took office, 149 executions have been carried out in texas. compassion was also a central theme of governor jeb bushs inaugural speech in florida on 5 january 1999: true compassion invariably begins with a single person... we should be known for the compassion of our dreams as much as their grandeur. in december 1999, governor bush announced his aim to speed up the capital appeals process, despite the fact that florida accounts for more wrongful capital convictions than any other state. in his inaugural speech of 17 january 1998, governor james gilmore of virginia proclaimed: virginias march into the 21st century begins today. since then, a further 12 countries have abolished the death penalty, taking the total that have abandoned judicial killing in law or practice to 108, more than half the countries of the world. in the same period, 34 prisoners have been put to death in virginia, almost half the total number executed in the state since 1977. amnesty international is urging president clinton to prevent the first federal execution since 1963, scheduled to take place on 12 december, in accordance with his claim that the usa has become a more decent, more humane country under his presidency, and the leading force for human rights around the world (see memorandum to president clinton: an appeal for human rights leadership as the first federal execution looms, amr 51/158/00, 14 november 2000). as the usa waits to discover who its next president will be, the urgent action network is asked to write to the countrys two most recent republican and democrat presidents to ask them to urge the governors of florida, texas and virginia to rethink their position on the death penalty in line with modern standards of justice and decency. recommended action: please send faxes/express/airmail letters, in your own words, using the following guide: - explaining that you are writing to the addressee to urge him, as a former us president, to use his influence for the promotion of human rights;

robert william clayton, native american, aged 39 robert clayton is scheduled to be executed in oklahoma on 4 january 2001 for the 1985 murder of rhonda kay timmons. his clemency hearing before the state pardon and parole board is due to take place on 30 november. nineteen-year-old rhonda timmons was killed on 25 june 1985 in her flat in tulsa. she had been stabbed and struck on the head. robert clayton, who worked as a groundskeeper at the apartment block, was arrested. he made two statements implicating himself as the murderer. he has since recanted the confessions and maintains that he did not kill timmons. at the time, robert clayton was a mentally impaired 24-year-old. a psychologist, who testified at the trial, assessed that he had an iq of 68 (indicating a learning disability), a tendency to be dependent and submissive, and was emotionally immature. the son of alcoholic parents, robert clayton had dropped out of school when he was about 12 years old. one of the police officers who questioned clayton admitted that he seemed a little bit on the slow side, and that it took a considerable amount of explanation to help him understand his right to remain silent and to have a lawyer present. the trial court ruled that the first confession was inadmissible on the grounds that clayton had not understood these rights. the second confession was taken after an attorney advised clayton not to make any statement, or to answer any more questions. however, when the lawyer left, the police took a second confession, allegedly on claytons insistence. the court ruled that this statement was admissible as evidence. given the lack of physical or eyewitness evidence positively identifying clayton as the killer, the confession was important to the prosecution. however, the trial jury did not hear the statement, as it had not been recorded. instead, it heard the police officers recollection of it, which has itself raised concern. for example, the officer testified that clayton had said that he had a knife with him when he went to timmons apartment. however, at an earlier hearing on the admissibility of the confession, when asked if clayton had mentioned a knife, the officer had replied categorically that he had not. the prosecutor then gave the officer a copy of the officers written report in order to refresh [his] memory. after reviewing the report, the officer stated apparently i stand corrected on that. prior to the trial, the court found that there was doubt as to claytons competency to stand trial, that is, as to whether he would be able to understand the proceedings and be able to assist in his defense. the court ordered an evaluation. a doctor carried out an examination on 11 july 1985 and, in a one paragraph report, found clayton competent. however, the court did not hold a competency hearing as required by law. on appeal, the court was ordered to conduct a retrospective competency hearing, if feasible. the court first held a hearing to determine if it was feasible to hold a competency hearing nearly six years after the trial. the only expert witness who testified at the feasibility hearing said that the available records concerning claytons competency were poor, and that it would not be possible to establish competency on such records. nevertheless, the court held a competency hearing, and in september 1991 ruled that clayton had been competent to stand trial on 1 march 1986. at the hearing, claytons trial lawyer recalled that he had had significant doubts about his clients competency during the trial. he described clayton as having the mentality of maybe like a seven or eight-year-old and he was unable to give me the details i wanted. this urgent action appeal was written at amnesty international's research headquarters at its international secretariat in london, united kingdom. amnesty international is an independent worldwide movement working impartially for the release of all prisoners of conscience, fair and prompt trials for political prisoners and an end to torture and executions. it is funded by donations from its members and supporters throughout the world. on appeal, the us court of appeals for the 10th circuit said that the time gap between claytons trial and the competency determination is troubling. furthermore it said that the report of the doctor who had found clayton competent in 1985 was admittedly brief. it also described as troubling the fact that one of the states main expert witnesses at the retrospective competency hearing had no independent recollection of clayton, had no records or files... and could not identify the bases for his conclusion. nevertheless the appeals court allowed claytons death sentence to stand. at the time of the trial and the competency hearing, oklahoma law presumed that a criminal defendant was competent to stand trial unless he or she proved their incompetence by clear and convincing evidence. in 1996, the us supreme court found that this burden of proof was unconstitutionally high, and that the standard must be a preponderance of the evidence. international standards oppose the use of the death penalty against people suffering from mental retardation or extremely limited mental competence, whether at the stage of sentence or execution. recommended action: please send faxes/express/airmail letters, in your own

(see memorandum to president clinton - an appeal for human rights leadership as first federal execution looms (amr 51/158/00), available with an open letter to president clinton (amr 51/164/00) on www.amnesty.org). the first federal execution for 37 years is looming at a time of unprecedented national and international concern about the us death penalty. amnesty international believes that president clinton must grasp the opportunity to send a strong message to his country that it is time for it to rethink its attachment to the death penalty. recommended action: please send telegrams/faxes/express/airmail letters, in your own words, using the following guide: - expressing sympathy for the victims of violent crime and their families, and explaining that you are not seeking to condone such crimes or belittle the suffering they cause; - calling on president clinton to commute juan raul garzas death sentence, noting that the justice departments findings of widespread racial and geographic disparities in the application of the federal death penalty are of direct relevance to his case; - expressing concern that the federal government is planning to resume executions after nearly four decades; - arguing that, even for those who support the death penalty, it is surely inappropriate for federal executions to resume in the knowledge that the system may be tainted by arbitrariness and discrimination; - noting the unprecedented national and international concern about the fairness and reliability of the us death penalty; - urging president clinton to live up to his often stated commitment to international human rights standards and his recent claim that the usa had become a more decent, more humane country under his presidency; - calling on the president to declare a moratorium on federal executions, in light of the justice departments findings, and as a step toward leading his country away from its lethally flawed attachment to the death penalty. appeals to: president bill clinton the white house office of the president 1600 pennsylvania avenue washington, dc 20500",0,"juan garza*"

athanasius smallwood, native american/hispanic, 31 dion smallwood is scheduled to be executed in oklahoma on 18 january 2001. he was sentenced to death for the 1992 murder of lois frederick. his clemency hearing before the state pardon and parole board is due to take place on 4 december. the body of lois frederick was found in a burned-out car in oklahoma city on 5 february 1992. she was the adoptive mother of smallwoods girlfriend. smallwood said he had struck lois frederick on the head with a croquet mallet during a violent domestic dispute. thinking he had killed her, he then put her body in the car and after driving around, set fire to the vehicle. it is not known whether the victim was ever conscious in the car. dion smallwood, who has a history of mental illness, was initially found incompetent to stand trial on the grounds that he was unable to consult with his lawyer or rationally assist in the preparation of his defense. he was sent to a psychiatric hospital where he received treatment. after nearly three months, the hospital determined that he could stand trial, although it noted that he remained a danger to himself and others, the standard in oklahoma for commitment to a psychiatric facility. at the time, oklahoma law presumed that a criminal defendant was competent to stand trial unless he or she proved their incompetence by clear and convincing evidence. in 1996, the us supreme court found that this burden of proof was unconstitutionally high, and that the standard must be a preponderance of the evidence. however, the appeal courts have rejected the claim that dion smallwood was found competent to stand trial under an unconstitutional standard of proof. at the 1993 trial, the defense lawyer called a psychologist as an expert witness. however, the prosecution objected on the grounds that the lawyer had said that he would not be presenting such testimony at the first stage of the trial. the lawyer explained that the psychologist would be unable to appear at the sentencing phase, and that his testimony was relevant to whether the defendant could have formed the intent to kill. however, the court upheld the states objection and the jury never heard any expert mental health testimony from the defense at either stage of the trial. dion smallwood had sought psychiatric help shortly before the murder of lois frederick because his condition was deteriorating. on 10 january 1992 he went to a mental health facility, stating that he was having a crisis. the relevant counselor was busy and asked him to come back in two hours. although she noted that he was obviously in relapse, she did not follow up on his whereabouts when he did not return. a clinical psychologist, who assessed smallwood after his conviction, found that he suffered from bipolar disorder (manic depression): this psychiatric disturbance when of the severity of that of dion, disrupts all areas of functioning, relationships, occupational, social, and often requires hospitalization to prevent harm to self or others. dion never had this necessary treatment. she said that had he received such treatment, it is unlikely that his situation would have created the intense symptoms he experienced that culminated in the death of mrs fredericks. she also noted that smallwood clearly suffers from the additional severe complicating array of problems of his unfortunate life circumstances. his childhood was marked by poverty, violence, abuse, deprivation and parental abandonment. his father (native american) and mother (hispanic) suffered from mental problems, and his oldest brother has been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and manic depression. dion smallwood has said: not a day goes by that i do not think of what i did and the pain ive caused... i wish i had never gotten up that day, but i cannot change that. i have asked gods forgiveness and i have asked lois to forgive me. i only hope that she has done that"". background information according to the us national alliance for the mentally ill (nami): after accurate diagnosis, most people with bipolar disorder can be successfully treated with medication in 80 percent to 90 percent of all cases. nami opposes the death penalty against persons with severe mental illnesses. the widely held belief that the execution of the mentally impaired flouts basic standards of decency is reflected in a resolution adopted in april 2000 by the un commission on human rights urging all retentionist countries not to impose the death penalty on a person suffering from any form of mental disorder or to execute any such person. recommended action: please send faxes/express/airmail letters, in your own words, using the following guide: - expressing sympathy for relatives and

[t]he race of victim effect was found at all stages of the criminal justice system process. no remedial action was taken. between 1910 and 1961, north carolina executed 282 blacks and 75 whites. although 13 of the 15 people it has executed since 1977 have been white, 14 of the 15 were convicted of killing white people. over 55 per cent of the states 232 death row prisoners are black. the population of north carolina is 75 per cent white, and 22 per cent black. recommended action: please send faxes/express/airmail letters: - acknowledging the seriousness of the crime, and expressing sympathy for the family and friends of kimberly crews; - expressing concern that michael sexton was convicted by a jury from which all but one african american had been removed by the prosecution; - expressing concern that this case fits a pattern of racial bias in the use of the death penalty in the usa; - noting that there is a legislative committee currently investigating the impact of race in north carolinas use of the death penalty; - stating that it would be unconscionable for this execution to proceed when the condemned man could yet benefit from the committees findings; - urging the governor to commute michael sextons death sentence and to support a moratorium on executions in north carolina. appeals to: governor james b. hunt jr. office of the governor state capitol 116 west jones st. raleigh, nc 27603",0,"michael sexton"

rather than give a straight answer, the judge replied: you should impose such punishment as you feel is just under the evidence... you are not to concern yourselves with what may happen afterwards. under virginias then three strikes laws, a person convicted of three separate crimes of murder, rape, or armed robbery becomes ineligible for parole. the jurors, unaware that ramdasss third strike meant that he would never get out of prison if they sentenced him to life, voted for death. the defence lawyer reported that three jurors later told him that they would have voted for life if they had known that ramdass would not be released from prison. in 1994 the us supreme court ruled in simmons v. south carolina that where a defendant's future dangerousness is at issue, and state law prohibits his release on parole, due process requires that the sentencing jury be informed that the defendant is parole ineligible.  however, the virginia supreme court, which has reversed fewer death sentences than any other state supreme court in the usa, ruled on ramdasss appeal that simmons did not apply to bobby ramdass because of a legal technicality. the court reasoned that because the judge in the second of the three cases - the dominos pizza robbery - had not yet formally signed the jurys verdict in that case when the 7-eleven jury asked its question on 30 january 1993, technically bobby ramdass was not at that moment ineligible for parole.  that, the state argued, only occurred 19 days later on 18 february when the dominos pizza judge signed the jury verdict. in 1998 a federal judge, citing simmons, ordered a new sentencing hearing. however, the notoriously conservative 4th circuit court of appeals reversed his decision, deferring to the virginia supreme courts hyper-technical ruling. one of the three 4th circuit judges dissented: splitting hairs when a mans life is at stake is not becoming to a judiciary or a legal system. i do not believe that due process requires or allows such arbitrary results... ramdass had a constitutional due process right to inform the jury of the wholly accurate information that by the time the sentence they were deliberating was officially entered by the judge [on 6 april 1993], he would be ineligible under state law for parole. on 23 november 1999 the us supreme court stopped ramdasss execution three hours before it was due in order to examine his simmons claim. on 12 june 2000 it upheld the death sentence. four of the nine justices dissented. they described as an acute unfairness the fact that the state had been allowed to use the dominos pizza conviction to argue ramdasss future dangerousness, while simultaneously denying the defence the opportunity to argue that conviction made him ineligible for parole.  the dissenting opinion said: even the most miserly reading [of simmons] supports the conclusion that [ramdass] was denied one of the hallmarks of due process in our adversary system, namely, the defendants right to meet the states case against him. the dissent continued: we know this jury thought the information was critical; we know this jury would have recommended life instead of death if it had known that ramdass was parole ineligible. bobby ramdasss childhood in washington dc was marked by poverty, abuse and neglect.  a psychiatrist has referred to his unbelievably dysfunctional family which has presented the worst possible role models for him. he was physically abused by his mothers husband, who denied that bobby was his child. bobby witnessed his mother shoot her husband (he survived) in an act of self-defence when he attempted to kill bobbys infant brother.  after she and her husband separated, she and her children allegedly lived for a while in a storage bin and stole food to survive. ramdasss criminal record began at the age of 14. the kayani murder occurred when he was 20, shortly after his release from a four-year prison term. in a november 1999 letter to governor gilmore, bobby ramdass wrote: youve already heard about all the bad things ive done in the past, and i did rob and murder... but now im not the same person i was then. i finally grew up... if i could, i would take all the pain away and change everything ive done. but i cant.  all i can tell you is i know the value of life now. he wrote that he wants to help young prisoners avoid his",1,"bobby ramdass"

rather than give a straight answer, the judge replied: you should impose such punishment as you feel is just under the evidence... you are not to concern yourselves with what may happen afterwards. under virginias then three strikes laws, a person convicted of three separate crimes of murder, rape, or armed robbery becomes ineligible for parole. the jurors, unaware that ramdasss third strike meant that he would never get out of prison if they sentenced him to life, voted for death. the defence lawyer reported that three jurors later told him that they would have voted for life if they had known that ramdass would not be released from prison. in 1994 the us supreme court ruled in simmons v. south carolina that where a defendant's future dangerousness is at issue, and state law prohibits his release on parole, due process requires that the sentencing jury be informed that the defendant is parole ineligible.  however, the virginia supreme court, which has reversed fewer death sentences than any other state supreme court in the usa, ruled on ramdasss appeal that simmons did not apply to bobby ramdass because of a legal technicality. the court reasoned that because the judge in the second of the three cases - the dominos pizza robbery - had not yet formally signed the jurys verdict in that case when the 7-eleven jury asked its question on 30 january 1993, technically bobby ramdass was not at that moment ineligible for parole.  that, the state argued, only occurred 19 days later on 18 february when the dominos pizza judge signed the jury verdict. in 1998 a federal judge, citing simmons, ordered a new sentencing hearing. however, the notoriously conservative 4th circuit court of appeals reversed his decision, deferring to the virginia supreme courts hyper-technical ruling. one of the three 4th circuit judges dissented: splitting hairs when a mans life is at stake is not becoming to a judiciary or a legal system. i do not believe that due process requires or allows such arbitrary results... ramdass had a constitutional due process right to inform the jury of the wholly accurate information that by the time the sentence they were deliberating was officially entered by the judge [on 6 april 1993], he would be ineligible under state law for parole. on 23 november 1999 the us supreme court stopped ramdasss execution three hours before it was due in order to examine his simmons claim. on 12 june 2000 it upheld the death sentence. four of the nine justices dissented. they described as an acute unfairness the fact that the state had been allowed to use the dominos pizza conviction to argue ramdasss future dangerousness, while simultaneously denying the defence the opportunity to argue that conviction made him ineligible for parole.  the dissenting opinion said: even the most miserly reading [of simmons] supports the conclusion that [ramdass] was denied one of the hallmarks of due process in our adversary system, namely, the defendants right to meet the states case against him. the dissent continued: we know this jury thought the information was critical; we know this jury would have recommended life instead of death if it had known that ramdass was parole ineligible. bobby ramdasss childhood in washington dc was marked by poverty, abuse and neglect.  a psychiatrist has referred to his unbelievably dysfunctional family which has presented the worst possible role models for him. he was physically abused by his mothers husband, who denied that bobby was his child. bobby witnessed his mother shoot her husband (he survived) in an act of self-defence when he attempted to kill bobbys infant brother.  after she and her husband separated, she and her children allegedly lived for a while in a storage bin and stole food to survive. ramdasss criminal record began at the age of 14. the kayani murder occurred when he was 20, shortly after his release from a four-year prison term. in a november 1999 letter to governor gilmore, bobby ramdass wrote: youve already heard about all the bad things ive done in the past, and i did rob and murder... but now im not the same person i was then. i finally grew up... if i could, i would take all the pain away and change everything ive done. but i cant.  all i can tell you is i know the value of life now. he wrote that he wants to help young prisoners avoid his",0,"bobby ramdass"

and 2) police or prosecutors who did discover that kind of evidence but suppressed it, again keeping it from the jury. texas is coming in for particular scrutiny on account of its rate of execution, the inadequacy of its system of court-appointed lawyers for low-income defendants, and governor bushs repeated assertions that all those executed under his governorship (now 135) have been guilty of the crimes of which they were convicted.  amnesty international has long had concerns about the texas capital justice system (see, for example, the death penalty in texas: lethal injustice, amr 51/10/98, march 1998, and killing without mercy: clemency procedures in texas, amr 51/85/99, june 1999). in an article in the chicago tribune on 11 june 2000, the paper said that its own research had found that, texas has executed dozens of death row inmates whose cases were compromised by unreliable evidence, disbarred or suspended defense attorneys, meager defense efforts during sentencing and dubious psychiatric testimony.  prior to the illinois governors decision to suspend executions in his state in january due to its shameful record of wrongful convictions in capital cases, the chicago tribune published its findings of a study of the illinois death penalty, concluding that capital punishment in illinois is a system so riddled with faulty evidence, unscrupulous trial tactics and legal incompetence that justice has been forsaken.  in its june report, the paper said that its investigation on texas had found that, the problems plaguing illinois are equally pronounced in texas and that additional flaws undermine the states administration of the ultimate punishment. on 15 june, us attorney general janet reno said that capital defendants should have, first of all, good lawyers who can properly represent them. in too many instances in this country, people being charged with a capital crime do not. in 1999 governor bush vetoed a bill, passed by both houses of the texas legislature, to improve the selection of lawyers for low-income defendants. governor bush can only commute a sentence if he receives a recommendation to do so from his appointees on the bpp.  a former texas attorney general recently said: theres no doubt if the governor tells the paroles board what he wants done, they do it. in any event, the governor can grant a 30-day reprieve, and then ask the bpp to review the case. recommended action: please continue to send faxes/express/airmail letters, in your own words, protesting at the relentless use of the death penalty in texas and calling on the governor and the bpp to use their powers to stop all executions in texas. you may refer to the information above and to any of those named in this ua. appeals to: the honorable george w. bush governor of texas po box 12428 austin, tx 78711-2428",0,"john satterwhite"

that his ruling should not be misinterpreted as a finding that thomas provenzano is a normal human being without serious mental health problems, because he most certainly is not; and that if the burden were on the state to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that provenzano is competent to be executed, the court would conclude that there is reasonable doubt. the court understands that this is not the standard, and that the state does not have the burden to prove anything. nevertheless, given the nature of the penalty, the court cannot help but be troubled by this fact. on 25 may 2000, the florida supreme court upheld the competency ruling. two of the seven judges dissented, saying: it is impossible to conclude in this case that provenzano has a rational understanding of the reason he is to be executed when we have a judicial finding based upon clear and convincing evidence that provenzano genuinely believes as a matter of fact that he really will be executed because he is jesus christ. the power of executive clemency exists to act as a safety net to catch those cases in which the courts have been unable, or unwilling, to provide a remedy. governor jeb bush has the authority to grant clemency on the advice of the board of executive clemency. he also has the power to grant reprieves of up to 60 days. background information at a florida house of representatives criminal justice and corrections council hearing in october 1999, representative howard futch suggested that because thomas provenzano believed he was jesus christ, the state should just crucify him. the legislator continued: id make him a cross, and we could take it out there to starke [death row] and nail him up. a subsequent editorial in a local newspaper described howard futchs comments as vicious, ill-judged and revealing. in his dim-witted way, futch has laid bare the truth of the death penalty in florida: its not about justice. its not about deterring crime. its about vengeance. in january 2000, the state legislature voted to adopt lethal injection as an alternative to the electric chair. legislators also voted for procedures to speed up death penalty appeals, despite growing concern about wrongful capital convictions in the usa (florida has released more wrongfully convicted capital inmates than any other state). the florida supreme court suspended the procedures in february to examine their legality, and in april, it ruled that they were an unconstitutional encroachment on the power of the court. it has made its own proposals for expediting appeals, which are currently the subject of consultation. recommended action: please send faxes/express/airmail letters, in your own words, using the following as a guide: - acknowledging the seriousness of thomas provenzanos crime and the suffering of his victims and their families;

given up his appeals. pernell ford came within a few hours of execution in july 1999 before his execution was stayed for the courts to consider whether he had been mentally competent to waive his appeals. he has now been found competent, that is, that he understands the consequences of giving up his appeals. from the age of six, pernell ford spent extended periods in mental health institutions, and by 13 was being prescribed powerful anti-psychotic and anti-depressant drugs. during his adolescence he attempted suicide several times, by methods including overdose, hanging and poisoning. he is also reported to have attempted suicide on death row. pernell ford, who is black, was tried in 1984 by an all-white jury (the griffiths were white). shortly before the trial, he dismissed his lawyers. he was found competent to act as his own lawyer despite his youth, his limited formal education, an iq measured at 80, and his history of mental problems. the only defence he offered was that god would intervene at the trial and bring the victims back to life. for most of the proceedings, pernell ford remained silent and withdrawn. there was no opening statement on his behalf, no objections, and no cross-examination of any witnesses. at his sentencing, pernell ford dressed himself in a white bed sheet, worn toga-style with a belt and shoulder strap made from a white towel. in a long speech, he asked the judge to have the coffins of the griffiths brought into the courtroom so that god could raise them from the dead in front of the jurors. after sentencing him to death, the judge told ford that by law he would receive an automatic appeal. pernell ford responded that he did not want one. as he was led from the court he reportedly waved to the prosecutor and said see you at the electric chair. he has periodically given up his appeals, but has resumed them when his mental health has stabilized. since being on death row, he has been diagnosed as suffering from schizophrenia and depression and treated with a range of drugs. pernell ford claims that since 1994 he has been able to transport himself anywhere on earth, by a method he calls translation. he has stated that one of his first translations from his cell was to india, where he now has a number of wives. he claims to have hundreds of thousands of wives in other countries, including the philippines, colombia, ecuador and spain, and to have millions of dollars in a swiss bank account, which will support his wives and children after his execution. he has said that when he dies he will become the holy spirit and sit on the left hand of god, and that he has already visited heaven in an earlier translation. background information in the past two years over 20 us death row prisoners have been executed after giving up their appeals, including two this year. on 22 march 62-year-old james hampton was executed in missouri after dropping his appeals. hampton had shot himself in the head at the time of arrest, sustaining serious brain damage. on 2 may, 28-year-old former nurse christina riggs was executed in arkansas two and a half years after she killed her two young children and attempted to kill herself by lethal injection. prisoners on death row may decide to waive their appeals for any number of reasons, including mental or physical illness, the strain of living under a death sentence, pessimism about their appeal prospects, or an overwhelming sense of remorse (see pages 24-25 of usa: failing the future: death penalty developments, march 1998-march 2000, amr 51/03/00, april 2000). whatever the reason, none can excuse the states involvement in the premeditated taking of a human life. under any circumstances, an execution is an affront to human dignity and serves only to deepen a culture of violence. alabama has executed three of the 34 prisoners put to death in the usa so far this year. since the usa resumed judicial killing, 632 prisoners have been put to death in 31 states.  the decision by governor ryan of illinois in january 2000 to suspend executions in his state because of its rate of wrongful conviction has sparked increased concern about

a leg, a part of her skull, and a piece of her arm and hand - were found in late 1985 and early 1986 in three separate locations. although there was significant circumstantial evidence linking robedeaux to her death and dismemberment, the authorities could not determine the actual cause of death, and to this day it is not known how or why nancy mckinney died. nevertheless, the state obtained a verdict of first-degree murder (defined in oklahoma as an unlawful killing committed with malice aforethought). perhaps the most incriminating evidence against robedeaux, although still not proof of first-degree murder, was a statement by lisa austin, who lived with him from october 1985 until his arrest. she said that he had told her that he had killed mckinney and cut her up. however, the credibility of this statement has been called into question because lisa austin only made it shortly before the first pre-trial hearing, despite having had several previous contacts with officials investigating mckinneys death. the courts have rejected appeals that the state has not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that mckinney was the victim of premeditated first-degree murder, rather than, for example, an accident, negligence, or a heat-of-passion act of violence, followed by an improper disposal of the body. at the trial, the jurors were given two choices: to find james robedeaux guilty of first degree murder or to acquit him.  the judge refused to allow them to consider second degree murder or first degree manslaughter as the defence had requested. the jury returned a verdict of first-degree murder. in july 1999, a three-judge panel of the 10th circuit court of appeals denied robedeauxs appeal, rejecting arguments that the judge should have given the jury at least one of these two extra sentencing options.  in december 1999, a different three-judge panel of the same court upheld the appeal of another oklahoma death row prisoner, kenneth hogan, who had made the same claim.  he was sentenced to death in 1988 after confessing to the fatal multiple stabbing of his friend lisa stanley.  the 10th circuit accepted that the trial judge in this case had erred in not allowing the jury to consider verdicts of first-degree manslaughter and second degree murder. kenneth hogan has been granted a new trial. james robedeaux is facing execution. us supreme court precedent states that when the evidence unquestionably establishes that the defendant is guilty of a serious, violent offense - but leaves some doubt with respect to an element that would justify conviction of a capital offense - the failure to give the jury the third option of convicting on a lesser included offense would seem inevitably to enhance the risk of an unwarranted conviction. such a risk cannot be tolerated in a case in which the defendant's life is at stake. as we have often stated, there is a significant constitutional difference between the death penalty and lesser punishments (beck v alabama,1980). among the international standards which govern the use of the death penalty in those countries which have not yet abolished it, is the requirement that it can only be imposed when the guilt of the accused person is based upon clear and convincing evidence leaving no room for an alternative explanation of the facts. on the evidence in this case, a jury could have reasonably found, for example, that robedeaux killed mckinney without malice aforethought, but as the result of an accident or during a heated argument, and then engaged in an unlawful disposal of her body to cover up her death. james robedeaux is diabetic, as a result of which he has gone blind in one eye and 50 per cent blind in the other.  he also receives dialysis three a week for renal failure. background information the usa has executed 629 prisoners since resuming executions in 1977, more than 400 of which have been carried out since 1990. the administration of the death penalty in the usa is riddled with arbitrariness, unfairness, and unreliability (see failing the future: death penalty developments, march 1998 - march 2000, amr 51/03/00, april 2000). amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases, regardless of issues of guilt or innocence. recommended action: please send faxes/express/airmail letters, in your own words using the following as a guide: -

both were charged with the murder, but the charges against eula mae were reduced. she was sentenced to three concurrent five-year prison terms, and released after nine months. since the trial, cecille fuller, who was working as cashier at the grocery store on 1 april 1983, has signed an affidavit that charles foster was in the store at the time he said he was. she also confirmed that he waited outside, and that he had been picked up in a truck similar to one identified as wileys. fosters trial lawyer had never contacted fuller, or others at the store, to investigate his clients alibi. in 1999, a judge on the federal 10th circuit court of appeals described the trial as in essence a swearing match between mr foster and his wife, in which cecille fullers post-conviction alibi evidence, bolstering charles fosters version of events and undermining eula maes, must be given weight. she noted that the prosecutors closing argument had described charles and eula mae foster as the two most important witnesses, and characterized the husbands testimony as totally unbelievable. the 10th circuit judge said that, under the circumstances, the defense lawyers failure to interview potential alibi witnesses can hardly be considered a tactical decision entitled to deference. she said that there can be little doubt that counsels performance fell far short of the mark. however, the other two 10th circuit judges voted to deny fosters appeal, ruling that he had not proved that the outcome had been prejudiced by his lawyers performance. under us supreme court precedent, a capital defendant must not only prove that their lawyer was ineffective, but that the outcome would have been different if the lawyers performance had been better. the lawyer had also failed to investigate charles fosters background to present evidence in mitigation at the sentencing phase of the trial. foster grew up in a household marked by poverty, alcohol abuse, parental absence and domestic violence. he was subjected to physical and sexual abuse as well as witnessing similar abuse of his siblings. charles foster remained in elementary school, where he was assessed as mentally retarded, until he was 15 years old. although not intellectually capable of promotion to a higher level, the head of the elementary school requested that foster be sent to junior high school simply because of his age and size. in 1993, a psychologist stated that fosters mental impairment was the result of brain damage from childhood head injuries (for example, he was once knocked unconscious for four hours, and left untreated, when one of his stepfathers hit him across the head with a plank of wood). the psychologist noted that fosters long-term alcohol abuse further complicates the picture with additional impairments in brain functions. foster began using alcohol at the age of eight. he was born to an alcoholic mother and may suffer from fetal alcohol syndrome, a condition linked to a mothers heavy alcohol use during pregnancy that can lead to mental impairment. international standards require that a person facing the death penalty be provided with adequate assistance of counsel at every stage of the proceedings, above and beyond the protection afforded in non-capital cases. in 1989, the un adopted standards opposing the death penalty for persons suffering from mental retardation. in march 2000, south dakota became the 13th of the 38 us death penalty states to ban the use of the death penalty against the mentally retarded. recommended action: please send faxes/express/airmail letters, in your own",0,"charles foster"

aged 28, former nurse christina riggs is scheduled to be lethally injected in arkansas on 2 may 2000. she has waived her appeals and said that she wishes to be executed. on the night of 4 november 1997, christina riggs killed her two children, justin dalton thomas (age 5) and shelby alexis riggs (almost 3). having sedated them with an anti-depressant, she planned to inject them with potassium chloride (the chemical used to stop the heart in us lethal injections), which she had got from the hospital where she worked. she did not realize, however, that it should be diluted before use. when she injected justin, therefore, he awoke in pain. she then gave him morphine and smothered him with a pillow. not wanting to inject shelby, she proceeded to smother her with a pillow also. she carried both children to her bed and lay them in it. she wrote a suicide note to her mother explaining her actions: i feel as if a dark cloud has hung over my life for many years...it seems that no matter how hard i try to better my life and the kids, i did nothing but make it worse... i hope that one day you will forgive me for taking my life and the life of my children, but i cant live like this any more and couldnt bear to leave my children behind to be a burden on you or to be separated and raised apart by their fathers and live knowing their mother killed herself. she then took a large quantity of anti-depressant pills and injected herself with potassium chloride concentrate. not being diluted, however, it ate a hole in her arm, collapsing her vein and never reaching her heart. the pills, enough to kill someone on their own, rendered her unconscious. she was discovered on the morning of 5 november and taken to hospital where she was stabilised in intensive care and kept under police guard. on the night of 5 november her family, who had still not been allowed to see her, hired a lawyer. before he arrived, however, the police took an eight-minute taped confession from christina riggs early on the morning of 6 november. much of her statement was inaudible as she was crying throughout, and towards the end appeared to be hallucinating. christina riggs was charged with two counts of capital murder. a pre-trial motion to suppress her hospital statement was rejected, and her trial began on 23 june 1998. she pleaded not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect, that is, that at the time of the killings she was unable to appreciate the wrongfulness of her conduct or to conform her conduct to the law. for the defence, a psychiatrist and a psychologist testified that her actions were the result of severe depression. they gave their opinion that, to her, the childrens deaths were an act of love and an extension of her own suicide. the psychologist said: the pathological suicidal depression that she was in.... effectively precluded her from being able to do something more reasonable, something more appropriate. from the outside looking in, the death of two children like this is pretty horrible. from the inside looking out, it looks like an act of mercy. for the state, a psychiatrist and a psychologist did not dispute that her suicide bid was genuine, but testified that they did not believe that she was sufficiently depressed to justify the defence of not guilty by reason of mental impairment. the jury agreed and convicted her of capital murder after less than an hour of deliberation. at the sentencing, christina riggs refused to have any evidence presented on her behalf and asked the jury for a death sentence: i want to die. i want to be with my babes. i started this out seven months ago. and i want you to give me the death penalty. i dont want you to feel guilty. the jury voted for a death sentence. christina riggs, who was sexually abused by a stepbrother between the ages of eight and 13, comes from a family with a history of mental illness and suicidal tendency. reportedly, her mother, sister, and a cousin all attempted suicide, and another cousin committed suicide.  her grandmother was twice committed to a mental institution, and her great-grandfather committed suicide in such an institution. her mother and siblings have been treated for depression. christina riggs own depression was reported to have been exacerbated by financial difficulties. she was a single mother working long shifts as a nurse. background information in the past two years about 20 people have been executed in the usa after giving up their appeals. for some, the decision to consent to their execution appears to be as a result of mental illness, and some had already attempted suicide. for others, the reasons may stem from physical illness, remorse, pessimism about their appeal prospects, or a wish not to live under the harsh conditions of death row. whatever the reason, it does not change the fact that the state is engaging in a human rights violation and deepening a culture of violence. the most recent consensual execution was that of 62-year-old james hampton in missouri on 22 march 2000. he had shot himself on arrest, and suffered from serious brain damage as a result. since the usa resumed executions in

yet up to then an unwritten rule had been that four votes were enough for the court to decide to hear oral arguments in a case. the courts rejection of the tarver appeal 5-4 appears to signal that prisoners will now have to reach five votes to obtain such a hearing in the court. governor siegelman had already denied clemency for robert tarver when the us supreme court stay was announced. amnesty international is urging that he reconsider this decision. as of 1 january 2000, there were 185 prisoners on death row in alabama. it  has executed 21 prisoners since 1977, including two this year. recommended action: please send telegrams/faxes/express/airmail letters: - expressing sympathy for the victims of violent crime and their families, and explaining that you do not seek to excuse the killing of hugh kite;

if i request that he be executed, i would be taking him away from michele [workmans daughter]. we suffered the same loss at the same time..... workmans daughter thanked her for her huge capacity for compassion and for rising above revenge. however, state officials continue to couch their support for the execution of philip workman and robert coe, a prisoner scheduled for execution 24 hours before workman who also received a stay on 4 april (see follow up to extra 139/99, 5 april 2000). tennessees attorney general said on 4 april: my heart goes out to the families and friends of the victims... and to the citizens of tennessee, who want and expect justice and finality to resolve these long-standing matters. we are disappointed for those people, who expect their justice system to work efficiently and in a timely manner."" since 1973, 87 people have been released from us death rows after evidence of their innocence emerged. recurring factors contributing to wrongful convictions include inadequate defence representation, misconduct by police and prosecutors, and the use of unreliable testimony and physical evidence. on 31 january 2000, the governor of illinois imposed a moratorium on executions in his state because of its shameful record on wrongful convictions.  that move has sparked increased debate on the reliability of the death penalty in the usa. no specific action for philip workman is requested at this stage. however, given that robert coe could still face execution within a few days, becoming the first prisoner to be executed in tennessee since 1960, if anyone is able to send an additional general appeal, it would be very welcome. you do not need to be specific to coes case (the governor has already denied clemency), but simply appeal in your own words for governor sundquist not to allow executions to resume. many thanks to all who have taken part in this action. appeals to: the honorable don sundquist office of the governor state capitol nashville, tn 37243-0001",0,"philip workman"

darrell keith rich is scheduled to be executed by lethal injection at san quentin state prison, california, in the first few minutes of 15 march 2000. darrell rich was convicted in 1980 of four murders committed in 1978. he was sentenced to death for the first degree murder of annette fay edwards (19), linda diane slovik (26) and annette lynn selix (11), and to life imprisonment without parole for the second-degree murder of patricia ann moore (17). he was also convicted of sexual assaults against five other women. the trial court rejected a claim that darrell rich was legally insane, suffering from a mental disorder that rendered him incapable of understanding the gravity of his actions. three psychiatrists and psychologists testified in support of this defense. the trial court did not conduct a hearing into darrell richs competency to stand trial, that is, his ability to follow the proceedings and assist in his defense. the judge had decided that he was competent to stand trial after reviewing the testimony of the mental health experts. darrell richs appeal lawyers have presented testimony from the experts who testified at trial. they state that they were never asked to evaluate his competency to stand trial, only the question of his legal sanity at the time of the crimes. they state that reviewing the evidence leads them to conclude that richs mental impairment, including evidence of long-standing brain damage, made it unlikely that he understood much of what occurred during the proceedings against him or that he could assist in his defense. the state has produced no expert testimony to refute these claims, only law enforcement witnesses who state that darrell rich did not appear to them to be incompetent. the federal appeal courts have ruled that the trial court did not err in failing to conduct a competency hearing, thereby ruling out this failure as an appeal issue. the appeal courts have also stated that it is now too late to conduct such a hearing to establish what richs competency was in 1980. darrell richs trial jury was at first unable to reach the unanimity required for a death sentence. at this point the judge did not instruct them that failure to reach a unanimous decision would result in an automatic sentence of life imprisonment without parole. instead he ordered deliberations to resume the next morning, and the jury later reached the required unanimity. darrell rich, who has cherokee ancestry, was adopted and raised as a mormon.  his adoption records describe his biological father and mother as each being indian and irish.  no native american has been executed in california since us executions resumed in 1977.  almost three per cent (15) of californias death row population is native american, in a state where the native american population is less than one per cent. this urgent action appeal was written at amnesty international's research headquarters at its international secretariat in london, united kingdom. amnesty international is an independent worldwide movement working impartially for the release of all prisoners of conscience, fair and prompt trials for political prisoners and an end to torture and executions. it is funded by donations from its members and supporters throughout the world. background information regardless of the issues of mental competency raised in this case, the crimes of which darrell rich was convicted were brutal. in opposing his execution, amnesty international does not seek to excuse those crimes or belittle the suffering that they caused to the victims and their families and friends. it seeks only that the state not add to the death toll with a punishment that a majority of countries have abandoned, and which is itself a symptom of, not a solution to, the culture of violence. an increasing number of relatives of murder victims in the usa are speaking out against the death penalty, rejecting the argument voiced by many politicians that an execution can help family members come to terms with their loss. there are some 550 inmates under sentence of death in california, the usas largest death row. seven condemned prisoners have been put to death in the state since the usa resumed executions in 1977. the most recent execution in california was of manuel babbitt on 4 may 1999. since 1977, the usa has executed 612 prisoners, and there are now over 3,600 prisoners on death row across the country. there are growing calls for a moratorium on executions on the grounds that the death penalty remains prone to error and racial bias. on 31 january 2000 the governor of illinois declared a moratorium on executions in his state because of its shameful record of wrongful convictions in capital cases. in february, the philadelphia city council adopted a resolution calling on the pennsylvania legislature to impose a moratorium on executions until the states death penalty could be shown to be applied fairly and reliably. recommended

however he did not testify at the trial, and the jury did not hear this evidence. at his first trial in 1979, the prosecution presented testimony from craig and mcqueen, as well as expert testimony that a handgun traced to wright was consistent with, but not positively identified as, the murder weapon. the mixed race jury voted 11-1 to acquit and a mistrial was declared. having come within one vote of acquittal, freddie wright was retried about a month later. craig and mcqueen again testified against wright. this time the jury was all-white after the prosecutor (with no objection from the defence) removed black prospective jurors during jury selection. the appeal courts have rejected the claim that the prosecutor acted in a racially discriminatory way, on the grounds that the claim should have been raised earlier. aside from the racial mix of the jury, the other difference from the first trial was that wrights former girlfriend, doris lambert, testified that wright had confessed the murders to her. after a two-day trial wright was convicted and sentenced to death. freddie wright maintains that he is innocent of the crime. according to his appeals, the jurors were left unaware of important exculpatory evidence, either because the prosecution withheld it from the defence lawyer, or because the latter failed to investigate it. the appeal courts have ruled that such evidence was not unconstitutionally withheld and that the jury would still have voted for death even if presented with it. the withheld evidence consists of: mary johnsons testimony that placed roberts at the crime scene; evidence that roberts gun was the murder weapon; an alleged secret deal between the state and mcqueen offering him leniency in return for his testimony against wright; and the mental health records of doris lambert undermining her credibility as a witness. according to these records, lambert suffered from auditory hallucinations in which she believed she was talking to her long-dead father; she had a history of homicidal and suicidal fantasies, as well as drug abuse; she had been on psychiatric medication for years, and had been described as manipulative by a professional who treated her. at the trial she denied the allegation that she had said, after learning of wrights plans to marry, that she would rather see him dead than with another woman. in a federal court hearing in 1996, roger mcqueen recanted his testimony and said that wright was not the gunman. background information in 18 june 1999, alabama executed brian baldwin, an african american whose 1977 trial was marked by racial discrimination, including the removal of all black prospective jurors from the jury pool by the prosecutor. since 1977, when the usa resumed executions, alabama has executed 20 prisoners, 13 of whom were black. the population of alabama is 75 per cent white. less than three hours before robert lee tarver, black, was due to be put to death in alabamas electric chair on 4 february 2000, the us supreme court stayed the execution. tarvers lawyers had appealed on the grounds that execution in the electric chair violates the constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment. the court has not yet said whether it will examine the claim. in 1999 it announced that it would examine the use of floridas electric chair, but after the florida legislature introduced lethal injection as an alternative, the court dropped the case. on 31 january 2000, the governor of illinois announced a moratorium on executions in his state because of its shameful record of wrongful convictions, having executed 12 and released 13 death row prisoners since 1977. in recent days, philadelphia city council has adopted a resolution calling on the pennsylvania legislature to enact a moratorium on executions until the states use of the death penalty could be shown to be fair and free from racial bias. there are currently two bills before the alabama senate judiciary committee which call for a moratorium on executions in the state (senate bills no 7 and no 60, sponsored by senator sanders). recommended action: please send telegrams/faxes/express/letters: - acknowledging the seriousness of the crime of which freddie lee wright was convicted and expressing sympathy for the victims relatives and friends; - expressing concern that freddie lee wright was convicted by an all-white jury after the prosecutor removed black prospective jurors; - expressing concern that the jury which sentenced wright to die were not aware of certain exculpatory evidence, including that a key witness had serious mental health problems which undermined her credibility;

diagnosed as suffering from paranoid schizophrenia. on 10 august 1982, junette bryant found the decapitated and mutilated body of her son ricky bryant at his home in fort worth, texas. next door, the police found the bodies of georgia reed and her 11-year-old son scott, as well as those of earline barker and bruce gardner. each of the victims had been shot in the head and their throats slit. georgia reed had also been stabbed numerous times. larry robison has never denied killing the five victims (although he was only tried for the murder of bruce gardner), but has maintained that the crime was the result of his mental illness. in a written account after the crime, he recalled how he had been called upon to liberate souls to ascend to a higher plane of existence, and described his hallucination that ricky bryant had urged him on even as he worked to sever his head from his body. larry robison described how a digital clock in the bathroom had flipped to a row of zeros and had then begun acting like a stop watch. he wrote that he had interpreted this as a message that he had to liberate as many souls as possible before the liberation of his own. larry robison was first convicted in 1983, but this conviction was reversed in 1986 by the texas court of criminal appeals because of an error during jury selection. at his retrial in 1987, he again pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity but again the jury rejected this plea, finding him guilty of capital murder. larry robison came within hours of execution on 17 august 1999. he was on his way to the lethal injection chamber when the court of criminal appeals issued a stay. his lawyers had filed a last-minute appeal on the grounds that he was mentally incompetent to be executed. after a hearing, however, a judge ruled on 15 november that he was competent to be executed. for further information about larry robisons crime, trial and illness, see time for humanitarian intervention: the imminent execution of larry robison (amr 51/107/99, july 1999). background information that larry robisons crime was of a very serious nature, and has caused immeasurable suffering, is not in question. his execution will not serve justice, however, but simply be the final act of a states failure to find an earlier, appropriate response to his mental illness. as the non-governmental us organization, the national alliance for the mentally ill, states: the death penalty is never appropriate for a defendant suffering from schizophrenia or other serious brain disorders. this urgent action appeal was written at amnesty international's research headquarters at its international secretariat in london, united kingdom. amnesty international is an independent worldwide movement working impartially for the release of all prisoners of conscience, fair and prompt trials for political prisoners and an end to torture and executions. it is funded by donations from its members and supporters throughout the world. the texas authorities will no doubt justify this human rights violation by arguing that two trial juries rejected larry robisons insanity plea, and that a judge found him competent to be executed. this does not alter the fact that larry robison had already been diagnosed as suffering from paranoid schizophrenia before he committed his crime, providing at the very least reasonable doubt of his legal sanity at the time of the killings. his case has generated much attention both inside and outside the usa, particularly as a result of the struggle of his mother, lois robison, who has campaigned tirelessly for his and other death sentences to be commuted and who had tried to get treatment for her son before he did anything violent (see document referred to above). amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases and believes that every death sentence is an affront to human dignity. each execution is a symptom of, not a solution to, the culture of violence. texas has accounted for 199 of the 598 executions nationwide since the usa resumed executions in 1977. it has consistently violated international human rights standards in its use of the death penalty. amnesty international is calling on governor bush to use his power to stop this execution as a genuine move away from his states appalling record on the death penalty. governor bush has overseen 112 executions in his five-year governorship. he is currently campaigning to become the republican partys candidate for us president under the slogan compassionate conservatism. in addition to the planned

perhaps, a measure of solace for some of those whove lost loved ones in terrible brutal ways. it is tempting to say their comfort is justification enough. but punishment meted out by the state must be more than a substitute for individual revenge. it is a measure of a societys moral code, of its regard for justice, mercy, and the rule of law. it is not from sympathy for the predators who have committed atrocities that the death penalty should be abolished, but from a profound aspiration to elevate society above the killers baseness and depravity. when the state kills in the name of justice, it makes murderers of those on whose behalf it acts. recommended action: please send telegrams/faxes/express/airmail letters, in your own words, using the following guide: - acknowledging the shocking crime of which andre graham was convicted and expressing sympathy for edward martin and the relatives of sheryl stack; - expressing concern at the imminent execution of andre graham, due to take place on the eve of international human rights day; - noting that andre graham, while admitting that he was present at the crime, has always denied that he was the triggerman; - expressing concern that this would be the 14th execution in virginia in 1999, more than in any year since the state resumed the death penalty; - noting that this directly contradicts the world trend to abolish the death penalty, with more than half of countries having stopped executions; - voicing opposition to the death penalty as a symptom of, not a solution to, the culture of violence; - urging the governor to commute the death sentence of andre graham as a first step towards abolishing this outdated punishment in virginia. appeals to: the honorable james gilmore governor of virginia state capitol richmond, va 23219",0,"andre graham"

white, aged 42 james beathard is scheduled to be executed in texas on 9 december 1999. he was sentenced to death in 1985 for the murder of marcus lee hathorn. there are serious concerns surrounding his conviction. marcus hathorns half-brother, gene hathorn, developed a plan to kill his family to inherit money his father had received in compensation for an injury. he needed an alibi, and allegedly discussed his plan with several people, including james beathard. on 9 october 1984 gene hathorn drove with beathard to the trailer where his father, step-mother and half-brother lived. at the trailer the three were shot dead. james beathard was tried first. gene hathorn testified against him, claiming that he, hathorn, had fired one shot from outside the trailer, but that beathard had entered the trailer and shot the victims. the prosecutor supported hathorns version, saying that there has not been one piece of evidence that says gene hathorn is a liar... he is telling the truth. beathard testified that he was innocent of murder, and that hathorn had convinced him that they were going to a drug deal which would give beathard the money he needed to pay off his child support debts. beathard was convicted of marcus hathorns murder and sentenced to death. at his own trial, gene hathorn repeated his version of events. this time, however, the same prosecutor said that if hathorn had told the truth, im a one-eyed hunting dog, and argued that hathorn had entered the trailer and killed his family while beathard had remained outside. hathorn was sentenced to death for the murder of his father and remains on death row. several months later, james beathard filed a motion for a new trial. at a court hearing, gene hathorn, who had voluntarily contacted beathards lawyer to say that he wanted to recant, testified that he had lied at both trials. he said that beathard had no role in planning the murders and did not shoot any of the victims. when asked why he had changed his testimony, he said, because james beathard is an innocent man. he testified that his earlier version was the result of threats from law enforcement officials and the prospect of a sentence less than death. the motion for a new trial was denied, because it had been filed too late. the court made no findings of fact or conclusions of law. the merits of hathorns new testimony have never been considered by any court. james beathard had initially been represented by a lawyer who was also acting for gene hathorn in other cases, an obvious conflict of interest. although he withdrew as beathards lawyer prior to the trial, by then he had already represented beathard during a crucial post-arrest period. he has since conceded that he was wrong to have taken beathards case at all. james beathard had no prior record of violence. at his trial, more than 20 people testified to his non-aggressive nature. they included the director and a psychologist at the mental hospital where beathard had worked as an orderly (and where he had first met gene hathorn, who was doing the same job). friends and relatives testified about his devotion to his children, and his distress at the breakup of his marriage, and the ensuing battle with his wife for custody of their children. several people, including gene hathorn at his own trial, have said that james beathard had never owned a gun, and barely knew how to use one. gene hathorn had a reputation for violence, was a skilled marksman, supplied the guns that were used in the killings, and was said to harbour a bitter hatred of his violent father. on 26 june 1998, governor bush granted clemency to henry lee lucas, and commuted his death sentence to life imprisonment, on grounds of doubts of his guilt (see update to extra 41/98, amr 51/42/98, 30 june). governor bush said: ""the first question i ask in every case is whether there is any doubt about the individuals guilt or innocence... in this case, at the time it made its decision, the jury did not know and could not have known that henry lee lucas had a pattern of lying and confessing to crimes that evidence later proved he did not commit."" the jury at james beathards trial could not have known that within months of their verdict and sentence, the only eyewitness to the murders would have recanted his version of events and asserted beathards innocence. moreover, the jury were unaware that the state prosecutor would present a totally contradictory version of events at beathards co-defendants trial. at the very least governor bush should grant a 30-day reprieve so that a full hearing can be held into this case. recommended action: please send telegrams/faxes/express/airmail letters: - expressing deep concern that james lee beathard is scheduled for execution despite doubts over his guilt in the murder of three members of the hathorn family in 1984; - noting that the jurors at his trial cannot have known that within months of their

""i imagine that you members of the board have received letters from supporters, perhaps from around the united states, perhaps from around the world. the last time i appeared before this board was in conjunction with scotty moore's clemency hearing. i told you then i had a feeling that these letters were something more than expressions of direct concern for scotty moore. i told you that probably most of the people that wrote those letters wouldn't know scotty moore if they saw him. the aag then showed the board a copy of amnesty internationals urgent action for cornel cooks which he had obtained and read parts of it to the board to demonstrate what he considers to be a political action. ""what is evident is that most of these letters are more about a political viewpoint and the general opposition to the death penalty than they are about cornel cooks. don't misunderstand me, i think these people have a right to voice their opposition to the death penalty. but, this isn't the proper forum. this is where people who are intimately involved with this case come forward to tell you why or why not you should vote for clemency. in july, aag humes received the appellate award for outstanding advocacy in capital cases from the national association of government attorneys in capital litigation (see oklahoma shamelessly celebrates its violation of international law and deepens its isolation, amr 51/120/99, 2 august 1999). further recommended action: please send faxes/express/airmail letters: - acknowledging the problem of violent crime, and expressing sympathy for the victims and their families; - pointing out that there are increasing numbers of such relatives in the usa who are speaking out against the death penalty, saying that executions do not ease their pain, and serve only to deepen a culture of violence; - expressing your own opposition to the death penalty, explaining that more than half the countries of the world have abandoned this punishment; - urging the governor to do all in his power to stop the execution of cornel cooks and all other death sentences that come before him. please do not mention aag humes comments relating to amnesty international at this stage. a separate response to these will be issued in due course. appeals to: the honorable frank keating governor of oklahoma, state capitol, room 212 oklahoma city, ok 73105",0,"cornel cooks"

an almost impossible standard to meet. the appeal courts have continued to fail to address many of the deeply disturbing issues in browns case. in the rejection of the last appeal, the north carolina supreme court cited the overwhelming evidence against brown, including: the discovery of his ring on the victims body, his bloody palm print on the wall over the girl's body, and the bloody footprints from the victims apartment to his (they lived in the same building). amnesty international believes the evidence against brown is far from conclusive. the ring did belong to brown and is undoubtedly a powerful piece of evidence against him. he claims he lost the ring after taking it off at a party where he was playing records the night before the crime. however, other evidence is much weaker than it first appears. the testimony at trial was consistent with the palm print having been placed on the wall weeks or months before the murders. apparently, it was not possible to tell whether the print was made by a bloody hand or the blood had splashed over it. brown had been in the victims apartment prior to the crime helping her move furniture. no other finger prints belonging to brown were found at the scene. thirty three other prints that did not match either victim were found but not identified. the police appear to have ignored the two other possible suspects for the crime, one of whom was positively identified by two witnesses as jumping from the balcony of the apartment block around the time of the murders. according to press reports, when the witnesses reported what they had seen, the police officers investigating the case told them, we got our man and yall arent doing but one thing, helping a murderer get set free. the trail of blood, as it is so often referred to in the media or by prosecutors, was in fact not visible to the naked eye. it was only discovered by highly sensitive forensic tests that were incapable of identifying the source of the blood. the authorities have failed to explain how a highly intoxicated individual, who would have been covered in blood after such a brutal crime, was able to clean himself and dispose of his clothing without leaving any trace of blood in his apartment, including in his drains, in such a short space of time. successive appeal courts have refused to grant legal relief to david brown, while continually acknowledging the faults in his trial. the court of appeals for the 4th circuit found that the district attorneys denial of pre-trial access to the crime scene and to witnesses was an error of a constitutional nature, but determined the error was harmless. a judge for the district court concluded that the conduct of the da was inexcusable, based on personal animosity (towards the defence attorney), that the das gamesmanship was especially abhorrent when a persons life is at stake, but that it was also harmless (in that it would not have affected the outcome of the trial). amnesty international is appalled that the latest and probably last round of browns legal appeals have once again failed to adequately address the apparent numerous violations of the us constitution and international standards governing the death penalty. for the diminishing list of countries which still resort to the death penalty, international human rights standards require the very highest level of fairness in capital cases, given the irreversible nature of the penalty. amnesty international is not in a position to know whether brown is guilty or innocent of these murders. however, the case has many of the troubling aspects that have been present in the cases of the 82 people released from death row after being exonerated in the usa since 1973. the execution of david brown would clearly be in contravention of numerous international laws and standards, including article 4 of the united nations safeguards guaranteeing protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty, which states: capital punishment may be imposed only when the guilt of the person charged is based upon clear and convincing evidence leaving no room for an alternative explanation of the facts. browns only remaining option is to seek clemency from the governor. in north carolina, governor jim hunt has sole authority to grant clemency. hunt has never commuted a death sentence in his seven years in office (nor in the eight years he previously served). no other north carolina governor has held office for so long without granting clemency to a condemned prisoner. further recommended action: please send telegrams/faxes/express/airmail",0,"david brown"

sentencing - phase of the trial where the jury had to decide between life and death. the circuit court was troubled that he had called no witnesses, and presented no evidence on mr cooks behalf... the court added, indeed, we are unable to glean from the record any second stage strategy developed to defend mr cooks against the death penalty.  what is more, by all accounts, [the lawyers] investigative efforts were minimal. however, the circuit court decided that the jury would likely have sentenced cornel cooks to death even if the lawyer had met his professional duties.  it denied the appeal. at the sentencing phase of a us capital trial, the defense is supposed to investigate and present any evidence and testimony that might persuade the jury to pass a life sentence rather than death.  if just one of the 12 jurors had been so persuaded, cornel cooks would have received a life sentence.  however, because of his lawyers failure to investigate and present relevant information, the jurors never heard evidence of cornel cooks abusive and deprived childhood, his mental impairment, his alcohol and substance abuse from a young age, his normally gentle nature and lack of a history of violence, and his remorse.  the circuit court noted with particular concern that the trial lawyer knew cornel cooks was remorseful, but made no effort to present that to the jury. cornel cooks grew up in abject poverty.  a psychologist has described his family life as chaotic, stating that the boy was a throw-away child and a street child most of the time.  his stepfather (he never knew his biological father) physically abused the children and their mother. cornel cooks has a history of childhood head injuries, and began drinking alcohol, encouraged by his stepfather, from the age of five.  he sniffed glue and acrylic substances, which can cause irreversible brain damage, between the ages of 13 and 24, and has said that he used every drug imaginable, except heroin.  as a teenager at school, he was in a special education program for children whose iq scores fell between 55 and 75. his iq had been measured at 75 (borderline mental retardation), but his performance in the program was average or below-average.  after dropping out of school, he joined the navy, but was discharged because he failed the aptitude tests. the psychologist who examined cornel cooks in 1991 found that he had marked impairment in memory, concentration, verbal comprehension, word recognition, and speech perception.  she found he had an inability to perform abstract thinking, such as drawing conclusions and using judgement.  she also testified that cornel cooks had repeatedly expressed remorse for what happened to jennie ridling, as well as confusion about the crime.  this confusion echoes his first meeting with his trial lawyer.  according to the record, when the latter told his client that the state was seeking the death penalty, cornell cooks did not understand what that meant. his lawyer said, ""that's what they do to niggers who rape white women."" this urgent action appeal was written at amnesty international's research headquarters at its international secretariat in london, united kingdom. amnesty international is an independent worldwide movement working impartially for the release of all prisoners of conscience, fair and prompt trials for political prisoners and an end to torture and executions. it is funded by donations from its members and supporters throughout the world. background information the un economic and social councils (ecosoc) safeguards guaranteeing protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty, adopted by consensus by the un general assembly in 1984, includes the right of anyone suspected of or charged with a crime for which capital punishment may be imposed to adequate legal assistance at all stages of proceedings. yet many on death row in the usa, too poor to afford a competent capital lawyer, received appallingly inadequate representation at their trials. recommended action: please send faxes/express/airmail letters in your own words, not mentioning amnesty international: -

aged 47 james chambers is scheduled to be executed in missouri on 10 november 1999 for the murder of jerry oestricker in arnold, near st louis, in may 1982. the two men had been arguing in a bar: they went outside when the owner asked them to stop or leave, and a few seconds later oestricker was shot dead. chambers was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death in december 1982. the missouri supreme court reversed his conviction in 1984 because the trial court had failed to give the jury a self-defense instruction. he was retried in 1985 and again sentenced to death. this was overturned in 1990 by the 8th circuit court because he was ineffectively represented at trial. in 1991 he was retried and sentenced to death for a third time. under missouri law, the state supreme court must review each death sentence to determine if it is excessive in comparison to similar cases. according to james chamberss appeal lawyers, the seven cases cited by the court in its proportionality review of chamberss death sentence are entirely dissimilar to his. they include a murder of a man during a kidnapping, a double murder where the victims bodies were set on fire after they had been stabbed, and the stabbing of a store clerk during a robbery. when the state supreme court upheld chamberss second death sentence in 1986, one of its judges dissented: this is an ordinary barroom altercation... under these circumstances, i cannot impose the death penalty. the judge said that failure to reduce the sentence to one of imprisonment would render proportionality in missouri totally meaningless. dissenting in another case in 1992, one of the judges said that the court has continually refused to face up to its responsibilities in proportionality review. at all three trials the jury rejected the claim that james chambers had acted in self-defense, and accepted the prosecutions version that it was a premeditated attack. chamberss current lawyers argue that his trial attorneys failed to present vital witnesses to back up the self-defense claim or to effectively challenge the credibility of the prosecutions main witness, who gave inconsistent and contradictory accounts of what happened when the two men left the bar. they state that the defense also failed to present evidence showing that oestricker had attacked chambers with a pair of pliers during the incident, and that he had a reputation as a violent bar-room brawler. the foreman of the jury at the third trial has stated in an affidavit that he does not believe that chambers should be executed. he claims that the experienced and skilful prosecutor entirely out-performed the defense team, and believes that the jury would not have sentenced chambers to death if it had heard evidence of his mental limitations. a mental evaluation of chambers in 1982 found that he had suffered from depression for about two months prior to the shooting, and that he had an iq of 78, which places him in the borderline mental retardation range. he is reported to have spent time in five mental hospitals for evaluation and treatment during his lifetime. he suffered a serious head injury at the age of six, and is alleged to have been regularly beaten by his father. he was diagnosed as mildly retarded at the age of 14 and at 17 was found to suffer from mental retardation, borderline, with psycho-social environmental deprivation. in 1977 he was diagnosed as suffering from incipient paranoid schizophrenia. none of this evidence was presented to the jury who sentenced him to death at his third trial.

movement working impartially for the release of all prisoners of conscience, fair and prompt trials for political prisoners and an end to torture and executions. it is funded by donations from its

sentenced to life or death can be strongly influenced by factors such as the quality of defense representation or the enthusiasm of the prosecuting authority in pursuing death sentences. since the usa resumed executions in 1977, 580 prisoners have been put to death, including 80 this year, more than in any year since 1954. amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases. every death

every execution serves to perpetuate a culture of violence. robert coes case, involving a brutal crime against a child, is one that has fuelled support for the death penalty in tennessee and galvanized its victims rights movement, frustrated by an appeals process which it sees as prolonged and preventing death sentences from being carried out. in 1995 governor sundquist reportedly held a press conference near where cary medlin was abducted to push for legislation restricting the number of state appeals in capital cases. the district courts decision in 1996 to overturn coes sentence contributed to efforts to impeach the judge responsible. this urgent action appeal was written at amnesty international's research headquarters at its international secretariat in london, united kingdom. amnesty international is an independent worldwide movement working impartially for the release of all prisoners of conscience, fair and prompt trials for political prisoners and an end to torture and executions. it is funded by donations from its members and supporters throughout the world. there are 99 people on death row in tennessee. the last execution was of william tines in 1960. the governor has absolute power to grant clemency. the board of paroles makes non-binding recommendations on commutation.  if robert coes execution goes ahead, tennessee would be the 31st us state to carry out an execution since the country resumed judicial killing in 1977. recommended action: please send telegrams/faxes/express/airmail letters: - acknowledging the seriousness of the crime of which robert coe was convicted and expressing sympathy for the family of cary ann medlin;

a trial never has such luxury. norman newsted had robbed a bar in utah earlier in february 1984 with doug kaye and cynthia brosemer. three people were killed. brosemer gave herself up, was granted immunity from prosecution, and gave statements to the police. the oklahoma prosecution relied on newsteds involvement in this crime as the aggravating evidence to persuade the jury that he was a continuing threat to society and should be executed. the prosecution was allowed to present cynthia brosemer as a witness, despite defence protests that they had not been informed that this would happen and were therefore unprepared to cross-examine her. in her original statements to the police, withheld from the defence, brosemer said that newsted fired two non-fatal shots in the utah bar, but that it was kaye who killed all three victims. however, her testimony in court under the prosecutors questioning differed to the extent that it allowed the inference that newsted may have killed one or more of the utah victims.  because brosemers police statements had been concealed, the jury never heard her prior unequivocal testimony that it was kaye who had killed all three. the 10th circuit court agreed that the prosecutor should have disclosed these statements to the defence, as well as a police report noting signs of a struggle on buckleys body and clothing, given its relevance to newsteds self-defence argument. however the court stated that this prosecutorial misconduct was not necessarily prejudicial to newsteds defence. in utah, doug kaye negotiated a plea bargain that allowed him to escape the death penalty for the three killings in the bar in 1984.  the utah trial found that norman newsted had not killed any of the utah victims. background information since the usa resumed judicial executions in 1977, it has executed 548 people, over 400 of whom have been put to death since 1990.  race, economic status and the quality of defence representation appear to play a major part in who will, and who will not, receive a death sentence. prosecutorial misconduct, and the use of unreliable physical evidence or witness testimony have also contributed to this lottery, and even to wrongful convictions.  eighty us prisoners have been exonerated since 1973 - including six in 1999 - after being sentenced to death. many came close to execution. the use of the death penalty in the usa frequently fails to meet minimum international standards.  for example, mentally impaired prisoners have been sentenced to death and executed, and the usa continues to use the death penalty against child offenders in violation of international law. oklahoma has put 16 people to death since it resumed executions in 1990. since 1991 the states male death row inmates have been housed in h-unit of oklahoma state penitentiary, where amnesty international believes conditions amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, in violation of international standards.  inmates are moved to solitary confinement in special isolation punishment cells 30 days prior to their execution date in order to stop them killing themselves before the lethal injection team does. they are subjected to regular cell and body searches, and may even be x-rayed.  this policy was introduced after an inmate attempted to kill himself by overdosing shortly before his execution in 1995.  norman newsted was moved into an isolation cell on 8 june 1999. recommended action: please send e-mails/telegrams/faxes/express/airmail",0,"norman newsted"

arkansas, colorado, georgia, indiana, kansas, kentucky, maryland, nebraska, new mexico, new york, tennessee and washington - now forbid the execution of the mentally retarded. in nebraska, for example, clarence victor was taken off death row on 30 june 1999 after tests placed his iq at 65. nebraska law makes it illegal to execute anyone with an iq below 70. a bill in the texas legislature, exempting inmates with an iq of 65 or less from execution, failed to pass into law in late may 1999. governor bush reportedly opposed the bill. on 5 may an editorial in the dallas morning news, stated: the moral sentiment behind such bans is simple: the state should not kill prisoners who cannot fully understand the concept of death. to use the ultimate punishment against people who cannot comprehend it is an act of vengeance, not an act of justice. governor bush is currently out of state. lieutenant governor perry will oversee charles boyds case. he has the power to grant a 30-day reprieve without the recommendation of the board of pardons and paroles, but cannot commute the sentence unless the board recommends it.  as well as seeking commutation, boyds lawyers are asking the lt governor for a 30-day reprieve so that they can complete forensic tests relating to the crime. recommended action: please send faxes/express/airmail letters in english or your own language: -

kennedy, aged 37, black victor kennedy is scheduled to die in alabamas electric chair on 6 august 1999. he was sentenced to death in 1982 for the murder, during a burglary, of an 86-year-old white woman, annie laura orr, at her home in the early hours of 24 december 1980. at the time of the crime, kennedy and his co-defendant, darrell grayson, also black, had been drinking heavily. they decided to burgle annie orr, who had occasionally hired grayson to mow her lawn and carry out repairs in her home in the small town of montevallo. ms orr was raped during the crime, and later died from suffocation as a result of having a pillowcase taped tightly around her head during the assault. victor kennedy turned himself in on 24 december after he heard that the police were looking for him. he gave three statements to the police. in the first he said that he had waited outside the house for grayson to come out. his second and third statements said that he had gone into the house, but had not taken part in the assault on ms orr. unlike with grayson, there was no forensic evidence positively identifying kennedy as having raped ms orr. kennedy was 18 years old, of limited intelligence and education (see below), and suffering the after-effects of alcohol at the time of his interrogation. despite this he was allowed to waive his rights to remain silent, to have a lawyer appointed as he was indigent, and to have that lawyer present during interrogation. the police officer who questioned him made little attempt to ensure that kennedy genuinely understood these rights (known as miranda rights). the officer testified at the trial that kennedy had responded yes to his questions about whether he understood his rights, but that he had indicated no further understanding of them. the officer reportedly testified that kennedy had pretended to read [his miranda rights] and did sign the waiver. the police neglected to tell kennedy that he could be facing the death penalty.  the three statements formed the main evidence against him at his subsequent trial. the rest of the evidence against him was circumstantial. the federal courts have rejected kennedys claims that his miranda rights were violated, ruling that he had missed his opportunity to raise this claim earlier in the appeals process. however, a district court granted kennedy a new trial and sentencing on two other grounds. firstly, it ruled that he had received ineffective defence representation at the sentencing phase of the trial, because his lawyer had failed to investigate or present evidence of his low intelligence, traumatic childhood or possible lesser role in the crime, evidence which could have mitigated against a death sentence. the court also found that the prosecution had acted improperly, by failing to provide the defence with graysons statements, which included evidence that kennedy may have had a lesser role in the killing. however, the state appealed and in 1995 the us court of appeals for the 11th circuit overturned the district courts ruling. the higher court decided that kennedy would not have benefited from graysons statements even if they had been made available, and that his claim of ineffective representation was barred on technical grounds, because he had not raised it earlier in the appeals process. between the ages of six and 11, victor kennedy lived in missouri with his mother and her husband. the latter, who was not victors natural father, drank heavily and used heroin intravenously in the young boys presence, as well as subjecting ms kennedy to severe beatings. on one occasion he stabbed her, and she had to wait until he was asleep before she could leave the house to seek medical attention. the beatings continued until victor was about 14, as the husband would continue to come to the kennedy home even after ms kennedy had left him. at 16, victor kennedy dropped out of school, where he had reportedly been put into special education classes because of his low ability, including in reading, writing, maths and science. at school his iq was measured as from the mid-70s to mid-80s (a person of average intelligence would score 100). this urgent action appeal was written at amnesty international's research headquarters at its international secretariat in london, united kingdom. amnesty international is an independent worldwide movement working impartially for the release of all prisoners of conscience, fair and prompt trials for political prisoners and an end to torture and executions. it is funded by donations from its members and supporters throughout the world. darrell grayson, who was tried after victor kennedy, is now on death row. he does not have an execution date at present. background information more than 400 prisoners have been executed in the usa in the past seven years, including 58 in 1999. many on us death rows were too poor to afford a competent trial lawyer. race continues to play a prominent role in who lives and who dies, with a death sentence the more likely outcome when the defendant is black, and/or the victim white. the most recent execution in alabama, that of brian baldwin on 18 june 1999, went ahead despite widespread concern that his sentence was infected by racism and prosecutorial and police misconduct (extra 71/99 issued 15 june 1999). he, too, was 18 at the time of his crime, black, indigent and convicted of killing a white person. amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases. any death sentence is an affront to human dignity; any execution serves only to deepen a culture of violence in society. recommended action: please send telegrams/faxes/express/airmail letters: - acknowledging the appalling crime for which victor kennedy

scheduled to die in alabamas electric chair on 9 july 1999. he was sentenced to death in 1984 for the 1983 murder of linda gail griffith, 42, and her mother willie griffith, 74, when he was 18 years old. ford, who has suffered from serious mental health problems and suicidal tendencies since he was a child, has given up his appeals. from the age of six, pernell ford spent extended periods in mental health institutions, and by 13 was being prescribed powerful anti-psychotic and anti-depressant drugs. during his adolescence he attempted suicide several times, including by overdose, hanging and poisoning. he last attempted to kill himself in march 1998. following a psychotic episode, he was removed to a strip (isolation) cell, where he reportedly found a knife, with which he gave himself a deep neck wound, and cut his wrists. pernell ford, who is black, was tried in 1984 by an all-white jury (the griffiths were white). shortly before the trial, he dismissed his lawyers. he was found competent to act as his own lawyer despite his youth, his limited formal education, an iq measured at 80, and his history of mental problems. the only defence he offered was that god would intervene at the trial and bring the victims back to life. for most of the proceedings, pernell ford remained silent and withdrawn. there was no opening statement on his behalf, no objections, and no cross-examination of any witnesses. at his sentencing, pernell ford dressed himself in a white bed sheet, worn toga-style with a belt and shoulder strap made from a white towel. in a long speech, he asked the judge to have the coffins of the griffiths brought into the courtroom so that god could raise them from the dead in front of the jurors. after sentencing him to death, the judge told ford that by law he would receive an automatic appeal. pernell ford responded that he did not want one. as he was led from the court he reportedly waved to the prosecutor and said see you at the electric chair. he has periodically given up his appeals, but has resumed them when his mental health has stabilized. since being on death row, he has been diagnosed as suffering from schizophrenia and depression and treated with a range of drugs. at a recent federal hearing on his decision to waive his appeals, pernell ford told the court that since 1994 he has been able to transport himself anywhere on earth, by a method he calls translation. he stated that one of his first translations from his cell was to india, where he now has a number of wives. he claimed that he has many wives in other countries, including the philippines, colombia, ecuador and spain. he said that he has millions of dollars in a swiss bank account, which will support his wives and children after his execution. he said that when he dies he will become the holy spirit and sit on the left hand of god, and that he has already visited heaven in an earlier translation. he stated his belief that he alone has been given such supernatural powers. pernell ford acknowledged that others believe he is mentally ill, but stated that they have misinterpreted what was in fact spiritual conflict. he said that he has never been mentally ill: i had a lot of problems when i was little, but nothing that can classify me as insane. background information a growing number of condemned us prisoners are giving up their appeals and consenting to their execution. the decision to waive appeals may be related to any number of factors, including mental illness, the severity of living under a death sentence, or an overwhelming sense of remorse. whatever the reason, none can excuse the states involvement in a premeditated human rights violation. under any circumstances, an execution is an affront to human dignity and serves only to deepen a culture of violence. alabama has put 18 prisoners to death since it resumed executions in 1983. most recently, brian baldwin was executed on 18 june 1999, despite widespread concern that he was the victim of racism and police misconduct (extra 71/99, amr 51/96/99, 15 june, and update, amr 51/99/99). in 1995 varnall weeks was executed in alabama despite his long history of mental illness, including schizophrenia. he believed that his execution would transform him into a tortoise, after which he would rule over the universe. a judge ruled that the execution could proceed, despite weeks being what the average person on the street would regard to be insane, because his ability to answer a few limited questions about his execution proved that he was legally competent. a psychiatrist recently found wernell ford to be competent to waive his appeals because he could make decisions about everyday transactions such as ordering sweets from the prison store. since the usa resumed executions in 1977, 553 people have been executed nationwide, most recently robert walls in missouri on 30 june 1999. recommended action: please telephone or send

a trial never has such luxury. norman newsted had robbed a bar in utah earlier in february 1984 with doug kaye and cynthia brosemer. three people were killed. brosemer gave herself up, was granted immunity from prosecution, and gave statements to the police. the oklahoma prosecution relied on newsteds involvement in this crime as the aggravating evidence to persuade the jury that he was a continuing threat to society and should be executed. the prosecution was allowed to present cynthia brosemer as a witness, despite defence protests that they had not been informed that this would happen and were therefore unprepared to cross-examine her. in her original statements to the police, withheld from the defence, brosemer said that newsted fired two non-fatal shots in the utah bar, but that it was kaye who killed all three victims. however, her testimony in court under the prosecutors questioning differed to the extent that it allowed the inference that newsted may have killed one or more of the utah victims.  because brosemers police statements had been concealed, the jury never heard her prior unequivocal testimony that it was kaye who had killed all three. the 10th circuit court agreed that the prosecutor should have disclosed these statements to the defence, as well as a police report noting signs of a struggle on buckleys body and clothing, given its relevance to newsteds self-defence argument. however the court stated that this prosecutorial misconduct was not necessarily prejudicial to newsteds defence. in utah, doug kaye negotiated a plea bargain that allowed him to escape the death penalty for the three killings in the bar in 1984.  the utah trial found that norman newsted had not killed any of the utah victims. background information since the usa resumed judicial executions in 1977, it has executed 548 people, over 400 of whom have been put to death since 1990.  race, economic status and the quality of defence representation appear to play a major part in who will, and who will not, receive a death sentence. prosecutorial misconduct, and the use of unreliable physical evidence or witness testimony have also contributed to this lottery, and even to wrongful convictions.  eighty us prisoners have been exonerated since 1973 - including six in 1999 - after being sentenced to death. many came close to execution. the use of the death penalty in the usa frequently fails to meet minimum international standards.  for example, mentally impaired prisoners have been sentenced to death and executed, and the usa continues to use the death penalty against child offenders in violation of international law. oklahoma has put 16 people to death since it resumed executions in 1990. since 1991 the states male death row inmates have been housed in h-unit of oklahoma state penitentiary, where amnesty international believes conditions amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, in violation of international standards.  inmates are moved to solitary confinement in special isolation punishment cells 30 days prior to their execution date in order to stop them killing themselves before the lethal injection team does. they are subjected to regular cell and body searches, and may even be x-rayed.  this policy was introduced after an inmate attempted to kill himself by overdosing shortly before his execution in 1995.  norman newsted was moved into an isolation cell on 8 june 1999. recommended action: please send e-mails/telegrams/faxes/express/airmail",0,"norman newsted"

for the first time - that it was kilgore who had stabbed the victim. prior to the trial, the prosecution had told the defence that lucketts girlfriend would not be called on as a witness. she herself was facing a charge of hindering the prosecution by lying to the police about lucketts whereabouts.  however, at the sentencing phase, the prosecution called her to the stand to testify. just before she testified, she had agreed to a plea bargain in which she was granted probation in return for pleading guilty to the charge she was facing. prior to the trial, she had been extensively interviewed by the authorities, but had never before claimed that bruce kilgore was the actual killer. her testimony was the only evidence suggesting that kilgore, rather than luckett, wielded the knife. in 1997, a court of appeals for the 8th circuit noted that this was doubtless damaging testimony, and may very well have been a major factor in the jurys decision to sentence kilgore to death. at the potosi correctional center, bruce kilgore is one of 12 members of the voluntary youth enlightenment program. this group meet with juveniles who have been in trouble with the law, and relate their life stories with the aim of helping the juveniles to make better choices in their own lives. background information since the usa resumed judicial killing in 1977, it has executed 548 prisoners, over 400 of whom have been put to death since 1990. as the pace of execution has accelerated, concern over the lottery of us death sentencing has deepened. race, economic status and the quality of defence representation appear to play a major part in who will, and who will not, receive a death sentence (bruce kilgore, who is black, was tried before an all-white jury). seventy-nine wrongly convicted prisoners have been exonerated in the usa since 1973 - including five in 1999 - after being sentenced to death. many came close to execution. others have been executed despite lingering doubts over their guilt. the usas use of capital punishment frequently fails to meet minimum international standards governing the death penalty. for example, mentally impaired prisoners have been sentenced to death and executed, and the usa continues to use the death penalty against juvenile offenders in violation of international law. one such prisoner - christopher thomas in virginia - is scheduled to be executed on the same day as bruce kilgore (ua 105/99 issued 12 may 1999). governor carnahan has the sole authority to grant clemency in missouri. in january 1999 he granted clemency to darrell mease at the request of pope john paul ii. meases execution had originally been scheduled to take place while the pope was in missouri. thirty-eight prisoners have been executed in the state since it resumed executions in 1989. recommended action: please telephone or send telegrams/faxes/express/airmail letters: -

aged 25 douglas christopher thomas is scheduled to be executed in virginia on 16 june 1999 for a murder committed when he was 17. international law forbids the death penalty for those under 18 at the time of the crime. chris thomas was convicted in 1991 of the 1990 murders of j.b. wiseman and kathy wiseman, the parents of his 14-year-old girlfriend jessica wiseman. he received a 65-year prison sentence for the murder of j.b. wiseman, and was sentenced to death for the murder of kathy wiseman. international standards ban the use of the death penalty against children, not to excuse their crimes, but in recognition of their immaturity and potential for change. by contrast, the us justice system has decided that chris thomas is beyond redemption, as it has with many other of its juvenile offenders. chris thomas was born on 29 may 1973. his fathers only contact with him was in hospital just after the birth, and in 1996 when he visited him on death row. when he was two, his mother moved away and he was adopted by his maternal grandparents. apart from displaying a marked fear of being left alone, chris thomas is said to have been a happy child until he was 12, in 1985, when several of his family died in rapid succession. an uncle with whom he was particularly close was killed in an accident, and his grandparents (his adoptive parents) died shortly after. chris thomas went to live with his mother. they were not close, and she did not respond to her sons insecurities as his grandparents had. he became involved in petty offending and drug abuse. he would often miss school and his grades plummeted. psychological assessments of him during this period describe an isolated, seriously depressed teenager who was alienated from school and home. in january 1990 he went to live with his paternal uncle and aunt, who threatened to return him to his mother when his offending continued. in the summer of 1990 he met jessica wiseman and the two became involved in an intense sexual relationship. her fathers disapproval of this escalated to his threatening to kill chris if he continued to see jessica. the children then allegedly devised a plan to kill jessicas parents, which culminated in the shooting of the adults in their bedroom on the night of 10 november 1990. on 11 november, under police questioning without a lawyer or an adult present, while still under the effects of alcohol and drugs, and having slept for only two hours in the past 40, chris thomas confessed to both murders. he later partially retracted the confession, saying that he had not fired the fatal second shot at kathy wiseman. she had survived the first shot, come to jessicas bedroom where the two children were, and been shot again. the possibility that chris thomas had not fired this second shot was not explored at trial. jessica wiseman was tried separately as a juvenile and was released in 1997 at the age of 21. chris thomass defence lawyers employed a psychologist to do an assessment of him for use during the sentencing phase of his trial. he found that chris thomas was a developmentally immature teenager, who in taking the full blame for the crime was trying to protect jessica. however, the defence lawyers became worried that this psychologist would be an ineffective defence witness. on the eve of the sentencing hearing they approached the prosecutions psychological expert instead and asked him to testify on chris thomass behalf, including testimony that jessica wiseman had been the motivating factor behind the boys actions. the prosecutions expert agreed, but stressed that he could not present a complete or adequate case for mitigation. it is highly unusual for the same expert, in effect, to testify both for and against a defendant, given that the two require different preparation and presentation. the jury decided that there were no mitigating reasons to spare chris thomass life, and on 21 november 1991 the judge upheld its recommendation for a death sentence. before the trial, a motion for a change of venue because of extensive local publicity on the case was denied.  shortly after the proceedings, a motion for mistrial brought by the defence lawyers after they received information that several jurors had known the two murder victims personally was also denied, as have been all chris thomass subsequent appeals. background information the international covenant on civil and political rights and the convention on the rights of the child both forbid the use of the death penalty against those under 18 at the time of the crime. this principle is now so widely accepted, and adhered to, that it has become a principle of customary international law, binding on countries no matter which international instruments they have or have not ratified. since 1990 there have been 19 known executions of juvenile offenders in six countries. nine were carried out in iran, nigeria, pakistan, saudi arabia and yemen, while the other 10, including the only four known in 1998 and 1999, have taken place in the usa. most recently, sean sellers was executed in oklahoma on 4 february 1999 for crimes committed at 16. in october 1998,

when the prosecution argues for death and the defence for life - moores lawyer chose not to make a closing argument. the higher courts have rejected subsequent appeals that this, or other shortcomings in the defence, amounted to ineffective representation. however, in a strongly worded dissenting opinion in 1998, a us district court judge said: the devastating effect of some errors simply should not be overlooked.  an attorneys failure to argue for his clients life during the sentencing phase of a capital case is that type of error... i can think of no stronger signal to a jury that a defendants life is not worth sparing, than the failure of anyone to speak for him. when nobody in the courtroom stands up and argues for the defendants life, it devalues the jury system, the court, and life itself... counsels decision to waive argument during the sentencing phase denied mr moore his day in court and denied the jury an opportunity to weigh the aggravating and mitigating circumstances [in order to decide between a death or a life sentence] on a fully informed basis. scotty moores defence team were not provided with the resources to fully investigate mental health-related mitigating factors. at the time of the crime, moore had had a long history of alcohol and drug abuse stemming from underlying chronic depression, learning disorders, and organic brain damage. the jurors who sentenced him to death were not presented with the extent of this evidence, including a suicide attempt at the age of 20. scotty moore was prosecuted by bob macy, who is reported to have obtained more death sentences - 53 - than any other us prosecutor.  in numerous appeals to higher courts mr macy has been accused of prosecutorial misconduct in achieving these sentences.  scotty moores appeals have raised the content of mr macys statements at the sentencing phase.  these included his encouraging the jurors to diminish any concern they might have of their responsibility in the death of a human being, by saying that they were a small piece of the machinery that is designed to take people like scotty lee moore and put them on death row.  the prosecutor appealed to the jurors patriotism, comparing military service during wartime with handing down a death sentence. the appeal courts have rejected the argument that any such statements might have improperly influenced the jurors. scotty moores alleged accomplice in the crime was his first cousin, who struck a deal with the authorities and agreed to testify against moore. moores current lawyers claim that evidence developed since the trial indicate that it was this cousin, rather than scotty moore, who shot alex fernandez. after the trial, moores attorneys found an entire investigative police file on the case, which had been illegally withheld from the defence, and which contained references to other suspects in the case. while in prison, scotty moore has educated himself about the law, his case, and about mental illness, including his own depression.  he has been an active campaigner for his and his fellow inmates civil rights in the face of the cruelty inflicted by the state of oklahoma on its death row prisoners.  male death row inmates are held in h-unit, oklahoma state penitentiary, an underground concrete maximum security prison in mcalester, whose conditions amnesty international has denounced as cruel, inhuman and degrading, and in violation of international standards.  in the early 1990's moore played a key role in drawing the organizations attention to h-unit.  despite being held in one of the harshest prison regimes in the usa, and despite suffering from bouts of chronic depression exacerbated by his conditions of confinement, scotty moore has been a model prisoner.  he has often helped inmates with legal or other assistance when they were unable to help themselves, because of illiteracy, lack of education or deteriorating mental health. one such prisoner was ronald williamson, whose serious and untreated mental illness moore documented and brought to the attention of williamsons attorneys.  on 15 april 1999 all charges against williamson were dropped after new dna evidence exonerated him. he had spent nine years on death row as a result of an ineffective defence and overzealous prosecution.  his was the 78th exoneration of a us death row prisoner since 1973. background information oklahoma has executed 15 prisoners since it resumed state killing in 1990.  the most recent execution there was of sean sellers on 4 february 1999, the first execution of a us prisoner for a crime committed at 16 since 1959, in blatant violation of international law banning the death penalty for those who commit crimes when under 18.  another 150 prisoners remain on death row, with the pace of executions accelerating.  the governor has the authority to grant clemency on the recommendation of the pardon and parole board. scotty moores appearance before the board will be on 18 may 1999. recommended action: please send e-mails/telegrams/faxes/express/airmail",1,"scotty moore"

every execution, with its message that killing is an appropriate response to killing, compounds the violence in society.  for many people, the ever-present risk of wrongful conviction is reason enough to abandon the death penalty.  since 1973 in the usa, 77 people have been exonerated after being sent to death row.  many had come close to execution before being released. concern over the high rate of wrongful conviction in illinois has fuelled demands for a moratorium on executions in illinois.  on 25 february 1999 house speaker michael madigan called on governor ryan to convene a summit on this ""very serious problem that ought to be reviewed."" in february 1999, a coalition of lawyers and activists called for an independent investigation into the cases of 10 death row inmates, who allegedly confessed after police torture and ill-treatment in the 1980s. in its november 1998 report fatal flaws: innocence and the death penalty in the usa (amr 51/69/98), amnesty international featured the case of one of these men, aaron patterson, currently on death row in pontiac prison, illinois. there are serious doubts about his guilt. recommended action: please send telegrams/faxes/express/airmail letters: - acknowledging the heinous nature of the crime for which andrew kokoraleis was convicted and sentenced to death, noting that he is also serving a life sentence for another murder;

it is not known how many innocent prisoners have been executed. the safeguards guaranteeing protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty, adopted by the un economic and social council in 1984, and endorsed by the un general assembly in december that year, state that 'capital punishment may only be imposed when the guilt of the person charged is based upon clear and convincing evidence leaving no room for an alternative explanation of the facts.' background information as of january 1 1999, there were 3,549 prisoners on death row. a total of 520 inmates have been killed in the usa since the resumption of executions in 1977. only three states, texas, virginia and florida, have executed more condemned prisoners than missouri. the last execution in missouri took place on 23 february 1999. the governor of missouri, mel carnahan, can grant clemency in capital cases.  he recently commuted the death sentence of a convicted triple murderer, darrell mease, to life without parole, citing a personal plea by his holiness pope john paul ii. during a visit to the usa in january, the pope appealed for a consensus to end the death penalty, which he condemned as cruel and unusual, stating that the dignity of human life must not be taken away, even in the case of someone who has done great evil. in may 1996, the conviction of lloyd schlup, a missouri death row inmate, was overturned when an appeal court judge ruled that he was more likely than not innocent. schlup had been convicted in 1984 of a murder committed in prison, but was found to have had inadequate legal representation at his trial. his trial lawyer had failed to interview inmates who witnessed the killing and said that schlup was not involved in the murder. lloyd schlup had twice come close to execution. in 1993, governor  carnahan stayed his execution eight hours before it was due to take place because of doubts about his guilt.

burnhary lagrand german nationals karl and walter lagrand (brothers) are scheduled to be executed in arizona on 24 february and 3 march 1999 respectively. they were sentenced to death in 1984 for the murder of ken hartsock during a bank robbery in 1982. attorneys representing the lagrands have appealed to the federal courts on the grounds that the defendants were denied their rights under the vienna convention by the failure by the state of arizona to inform them of their right to contact and seek assistance (as german nationals) from the german authorities - article 36 of the vienna convention of consular relations, states that any foreign national detained by the authorities must be informed of their right to contact the embassy of their nationality. although the courts have acknowledged that this claim is undisputed"", they have said that the claim is procedurally defaulted (i.e. had been lost to the defendants) because it was not raised during appeals in arizonas state courts. the federal courts have, therefore, refused to examine the issue. because awareness of the vienna convention in the usa is limited (although it has improved recently) it is likely that the lagrands original attorneys were unaware of it. it therefore appears that the courts are refusing to look at the denial of the lagrands rights because of the ignorance or ineffectiveness of their original attorneys in not raising it in state courts. amnesty international deplores this refusal to consider correcting the denial of a defendants rights. according to attorneys currently representing the lagrands, officials tried to correct the vienna convention violation (over 16 years after their arrest) by recently asking at least one of the brothers to sign a statement informing him of his right to contact the german consulate. the lagrands are currently appealing against their execution on the grounds that the method to be used would constitute cruel and unusual punishment, in violation of the us constitution. death row inmates in arizona sentenced before 1992 are given a choice of execution: by lethal gas or by lethal injection. if the inmate does not or refuses to choose lethal injection, as the lagrands have, the execution must be carried out by lethal gas (as the legally prescribed method at the time of sentencing). in 1994, an us district court and the 9th us circuit court of appeals ruled that execution by lethal gas constituted cruel and unusual punishment. the district court judge ruled that prisoners suffered excruciating pain for between 15 seconds and several minutes and that a gas chamber execution violates evolving standards of human decency and has no place in a civilised society. after appeals by 14 states against these rulings the supreme court ruled that where the inmate is given a choice of execution, lethal gas did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment. the supreme court instructed the lower courts, however, to examine the issue further. amnesty international is unaware of the current state of the law regarding execution by lethal gas but believes that all forms of execution constitute an extreme physical and mental assault on a person already rendered helpless by government authorities. the physical pain caused by the action of killing a human being cannot be quantified. nor can the psychological suffering caused by the foreknowledge of death at the hands of the state. therefore, all executions constitute cruel, inhuman this urgent action appeal originated from amnesty internationals research headquarters at the international secretariat in london, united kingdom. amnesty international is an independent worldwide movement working for the international protection of human rights. it seeks the release of men and women detained anywhere because of their beliefs, color, sex, ethnic origin, language or religious creed, provided they have not used nor advocated violence. these are termed prisoners of conscience. it works for fair and prompt trials for all political prisoners and works on behalf of such people detained without charge or trial. it opposes the death penalty, extra-judicial executions (political killings), disappearances and torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment of all prisoners without reservation. and degrading treatment in violation of article 5 of the universal declaration of human rights. background information amnesty international is currently aware of 74 foreign nationals, from 26 countries, under sentence of death in the usa. the vast majority were not informed by the arresting authorities of their right to seek assistance under the vienna convention. the us courts continually refuse to rectify the possible prejudice caused to the trials of foreigners on death row by the violation of their vienna convention rights. in the case of canadian national joseph faulder, however, the state department wrote to the authorities in texas requesting his execution be stayed on the grounds that had he been granted his rights under the vienna convention he may not have been sentenced to death (see ua amr 51/106/98 for further details). on 1 october 1998, there were 121 prisoners under sentence of death in arizona. the most recent execution was that of arthur martin ross on 29 april 1998. eleven prisoners have been executed under the states current death penalty laws. in arizona the governor may only grant clemency or reprieves if a positive recommendation comes from the state board of clemency. recommended

issued 3 november 1998 and re-issued 18 november 1998 death penalty / legal concern usa (california)        jaturun siripongs, thai national, aged 43 jaturun siripongs is scheduled to be executed on 9 february 1999.  he was sentenced to death in 1983 for the murder of packovan wattanaporn and quach nguyen during a robbery at pantai market in garden grove, california, in 1981, 18 months after he arrived in the usa from thailand. siripongs came within six hours of execution in november 1998.  he had had his final meal when he was granted a stay by a federal judge on the grounds that governor wilson may have denied the prisoner due process when he denied clemency. the judge lifted the stay in early december, noting that siripongs would have another opportunity to request clemency.  that request will be considered by the new governor who took office in january 1999. the clemency petition raises doubt about whether jaturun siripongs committed the double murder. he does not deny that he took part in the robbery but maintains that an accomplice, whom he refuses to identify because he does not want to shirk his own responsibility in the crime, killed the two people without his consent.  there is evidence to indicate that cuts sustained to jaturun siripongs hands during the robbery were caused when he tried to prevent the stabbing of one of the victims, rather than as a result of wielding the knife himself. siripongs current lawyers maintain that a witness called by the prosecution at the trial to testify that she was not present at the crime, may have been the accomplice and actual killer. according to the clemency petition, there were fingerprints, blood, and a clump of hair left at the scene of the crime which came from neither the victims nor jaturun siripongs. the latters lawyers are calling for, at the very least, a reprieve so that this and other physical evidence can be scientifically tested. after his arrest, jaturun siripongs should have been informed of his right to contact and seek assistance from the thai consulate, as provided by article 36 of the vienna convention on consular relations, ratified by the usa in 1969. however, like most of the more than 70 foreign nationals currently on death row in the usa, he was not informed of this right. access to consular legal expertise and resources, such as interpreters and cultural advice, can be crucial in a capital system where defence representation at trial is often shown to be inadequate. at jaturun siripongs trial, his defence lawyer reportedly tried to convince the jury that the defendant had not been at pantai market at the time of the crime, despite siripongs telling him that he had participated in the robbery. in addition, the lawyer did not investigate or present any mitigating evidence to the jury concerning jaturun siripongs life in thailand, marked by a seriously unstable and deprived childhood. by all accounts, jaturun siripongs has been a model prisoner in san quentin prison where he has continued to study and live by his buddhist beliefs.  before his previous execution date in november 1998, one prison officer wrote a note to him: ""at this time, not knowing what to say, i want you to know that knowing you and having worked for you has enriched my life."" another officer supports clemency ""based on his contribution to the safety and well-being of correctional officers and other inmates.""  in 1998 a former warden of san quentin wrote to governor wilson ""to urge your favourable consideration of clemency"", concluding that ""clemency will promote the safety and security of the institution. this former warden favours the death penalty and has never previously supported clemency. several jurors from the original trial have since expressed reservations about the appropriateness of the sentence. for example, one has appealed for clemency after learning about siripongs background for the first time, his ""adjustment to prison"", and his ""questionable defence"" at trial. suruchai wattanaporn, the widower of packovan wattanaporn, has also stated that, as a buddhist, he does not seek revenge for his wifes death and in november wrote to governor wilson appealing for clemency for jaturun siripongs. neither do the relatives of quach nguyen seek his execution. the thai government has also appealed for clemency, stating that it is willing to imprison him in thailand if his death sentence is commuted. the governor has sole power to grant clemency. this will be the first request for clemency to come before governor davis since he assumed office. there are over 500 people under sentence of death in the state, the largest death row in the usa.  five prisoners have been executed there since 1977, most recently thomas thompson on 14 july 1998.  in the same period, 508 inmates have been put to death nationwide.  the most recent execution, that of mark arlo sheppard, was carried out in virginia on 20 january 1999. further

sort of like those great military terms surgical strike, removal of prime target.  not once did he say, ""we gotta kill someone to make room for you sean. 8 december: somewhere in the day a state psychologist came to my door with a clipboard... he said he was here to help me make this transition. that set me off. i said ""how are you going to do that? what the hell do you know about being executed? ive been here for 12 years. ive seen all the executions oklahoma has done, and ive seen my best friends die here, so what do you know about it?"" the thing is, he seems like a nice guy, and i felt guilty for snapping at him. 9 december: well its real now! here i am in the solitary cell... this cell feels very, very lonely. its going to be hard to live in here. i cant tell whether its day or night from in here. and time moves more slowly. its only 4.30pm but it feels like night time. like ive already been here for 10 hours, rather than three. 14 december: all prisons have those nights when hell seems to seep up through the floor and surround you. for some reason, some vigilant guard counted me every half hour last night. every half hour, from 10pm to 6am, that outer door racked open, zzzz-crack! a light shined on my face, and the door was slammed shut. blam! all night long... 18 december: later i hollered up to john castro. the ventilation ducts in these cells are connected... we talked about our art, and having to give up our paints and brushes [sean sellers has become an accomplished artist in prison - he was not allowed to bring his artists materials to solitary confinement]... then john told me something that flabbergasted me. johns been here for 14 years. his 2-year-old son grew up while he was here, and theyre close! they call, write, and visit. at his 30-day review the warden told john he cant put his 16 year old son on the witness list to be present during his execution. the warden said 16 was too young to watch something like that. apparently in oklahoma you can be sentenced to death at 16, but you cant watch that sentence carried out... 21 december: i just heard on the radio that john was denied 4 to 0 at his clemency hearing... now he returns to his cell and prepares himself to die. the world has given him its final word; it has rejected him body and soul, breath and life. it has said, ""you are not fit to live"". and again i turn inward and ask, can a man make up for his crimes? is there nothing he can ever do? for john castro the world has answered. it has said no. 28 december: [sean has learned of public support for his execution] is there no room in the world for a man to do some good with his life? would you stomp his hands at every feeble grasp to straighten a bruised flower, to bandage a wound, to reflect a light upon a darkened soul? if he dares to reach out of his cage to give a cup of his water to someone in thirst, would you cut his hand off?

every execution, with its message that killing is an appropriate response to killing, compounds the violence in society.  for many people, the ever-present risk of wrongful conviction is reason enough to abandon the death penalty. since 1973 in the usa, 75 innocent people have been sent to death row before being released. many came close to execution. this urgent action appeal originated from amnesty internationals research headquarters at the international secretariat in london, united kingdom. amnesty international is an independent worldwide movement working for the international protection of human rights. it seeks the release of men and women detained anywhere because of their beliefs, color, sex, ethnic origin, language or religious creed, provided they have not used nor advocated violence. these are termed prisoners of conscience. it works for fair and prompt trials for all political prisoners and works on behalf of such people detained without charge or trial. it opposes the death penalty, extra-judicial executions (political killings), disappearances and torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment of all prisoners without reservation. article 6(5) of the international covenant on civil and political rights (iccpr) forbids the use of the death penalty for crimes committed when under 18. when the usa ratified the iccpr, it reserved the right to continue to sentence to death and execute juvenile offenders.  the un human rights committee has ruled that the us reservation is incompatible with the object and purpose of the iccpr and should be withdrawn. eighteen juvenile offenders are known to have been executed in six countries since 1990. half of them have been put to death in the usa. texas has executed seven juvenile offenders since 1986, including two in 1998. since executions resumed in the usa in 1977, 493 people have been executed nationwide, most recently larry gilbert and jd gleaton in a double execution in south carolina on 4 december 1998.  in texas, the governor needs a favourable recommendation from the board of pardons and paroles to grant clemency, although he is not obliged to follow such a recommendation.  execution is by lethal injection. recommended action: please send faxes/express/airmail letters: - expressing concern that shaka sankofa, formerly gary graham, is scheduled for execution (use both names in appeals);

american amnesty international has received further information on tuan anh nguyen, the former child refugee from vietnam scheduled to be executed in oklahoma on 10 december 1998, the 50th anniversary of the adoption of the universal declaration of human rights. in the seven years that tuan nguyen has been held in h-unit of oklahoma state penitentiary, his mental health is reported to have deteriorated to the point that there is now serious doubt over whether he understands his punishment.  in recent years he is reported to have had repeated psychotic-like episodes in his cell where he would scream for extended periods. international standards prohibit the use of the death penalty against ""persons who have become insane"" (safeguard 6, un safeguards guaranteeing protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty, adopted 1984), and recommend that it not be used against people of ""extremely limited mental competence, whether at the stage of sentence or execution"" (un economic and social council, resolution 1989/64, adopted 24 may 1989). whereas tuan nguyen used to show active interest in his own case, he has been unable to assist his lawyers in any meaningful way for several years. for many years he has refused to leave his cell for anything apart from to shower.  the last time he agreed to leave his cell to meet with his lawyer was for a 10-minute meeting in early 1994, during which he said nothing for the majority of the time.  during the meeting tuan nguyen's mouth constantly worked in a back and forward motion.  on a recent visit on 20 august 1998, his attorney spoke to tuan nguyen through the ""bean hole"" (the hole through which the food tray is passed) in the bottom of the cell door. his answers to the lawyer's questions were restricted to ""yes"" or ""no"" or silence, would take an unusually long time to emerge, and his lips and mouth moved in an ""odd repetitive pattern"". on 30 september 1998, a psychiatrist hired by the defense team went to h-unit to see tuan nguyen, but again the prisoner refused to leave his cell.  the psychiatrist observed tuan nguyen through the bean hole. very little communication was possible. tuan nguyen paused for long periods with an involuntary mouth movement and throat contractions which caused him to choke and cough.  the psychiatrist believes that tuan nguyen could be suffering from degenerative neurological disease with cognitive impairment. he noted that a conclusive finding was not possible without proper neurological testing in a hospital setting. tuan nguyen's execution date was set on 8 october.  at the request of his lawyers, prison officials took a mobile telephone to tuan nguyen's cell door.  because he was incapable of dialing the number, an official did so for him and placed the telephone in his hands.  tuan nguyen gave no response to the news of his impending execution. on 23 october, tuan nguyen's lawyer wrote to the prison warden indicating that there was ""good reason to believe"" that tuan nguyen was insane as defined by oklahoma law (that is, he does not understand the nature of his punishment).  two weeks later, the warden responded that tuan nguyen was not insane.  it is not known what other person or persons the warden relied upon to make this determination of sanity.  tuan nguyen's lawyers were not present to cross-examine any such person, and they are appealing that a proper hearing be conducted into their client's mental health. on 17 november, the pardon and parole board tied 2-2 on the case of john wayne duvall, scheduled for execution on 17 december.  it was the first time that an inmate has received two votes for clemency since oklahoma resumed executions in 1990.  two board members voted for life without parole, and two voted against clemency.  the fifth board member abstained because he had worked as a clerk for a court when it had heard one of john duvall's earlier appeals.  this effectively denied john duvall the opportunity to gain a majority vote in favor of clemency.  the 2-2 result was recorded as clemency denied. john walter castro, who is a native american, remains scheduled for execution on 7 january 1999.  he is said to have been a model prisoner, and to have become an accomplished artist. all three prisoners remain in high-max solitary punishment cells. please continue appeals as specified in original ua (including on 60-day lockdown policy to james l. saffle).  appeals for john duvall should go to governor only (noting the board's tied vote after an abstention as a reason for the governor to seriously consider clemency) and those for john castro to both governor and parole board. also please send as many additional appeals as possible for tuan nguyen to the governor, expressing deep concern at reports that tuan nguyen may be insane under oklahoma law, and calling for clemency and a full hearing into his sanity. governor frank keating          (dear governor) 212 state capitol

10 of them black - were convicted of murdering a white person. amnesty international has been unable to establish the proportion of black murder victims in the state of maryland as it appears no such statistics exist. however, approximately half of all murder victims in the us are black. one quarter of marylands population is black. there is also a geographical bias in the administration of the death penalty. ten of the 15 men on death row were convicted and sentenced in baltimore county, even though the nearby baltimore city has a much higher murder rate (but only accounts for one of the 15 currently on death row). this urgent action appeal originated from amnesty internationals research headquarters at the international secretariat in london, united kingdom. amnesty international is an independent worldwide movement working for the international protection of human rights. it seeks the release of men and women detained anywhere because of their beliefs, color, sex, ethnic origin, language or religious creed, provided they have not used nor advocated violence. these are termed prisoners of conscience. it works for fair and prompt trials for all political prisoners and works on behalf of such people detained without charge or trial. it opposes the death penalty, extra-judicial executions (political killings), disappearances and torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment of all prisoners without reservation. in 1996 the governor of maryland appointed a task force to look into the racial disparity in the use of the death penalty. although its findings were inconclusive, the task force found that the high percentage of african-american prisoners under sentence of death and the low percentage of prisoners under sentence of death whose victims were african-americans remains a cause for concern. to amnesty internationals knowledge, no further action has been taken to redress the racial bias in the administration of the death penalty in maryland. the last people to be executed in maryland were john thanos (white, white victim) in 1994, after he refused to continue with his legal appeals, and flint hunt (black, white victim, executed in 1997). the state governor has sole power to commute a death sentence in maryland. recommended action: please send telegrams/e-mails/faxes/express/airmail",1,"john thanos"

hence not fully responsible for their actions - and that there is greater potential for the rehabilitation of a juvenile offender than for an adult. dwayne wrights life experience echoes those of many juvenile offenders on death row in the usa: a deprived childhood, exposure to violence from an early age, and mental health problems.  he grew up in a poor family in a deprived neighbourhood of washington dc, where he was said to have witnessed regular violence, including shootings and murders.  at the age of four, he lost his father to prison.  when he was 10, his older half-brother was murdered, causing him serious emotional problems.  at his trial in 1991, although he showed little emotion throughout, he wept as his mother described his despair over the loss of his brother. at the age of 12, dwayne wright was admitted to hospital and diagnosed with depression. a doctor evaluated his mental capacity as borderline retarded, and his verbal ability as retarded. when he was about 15, he was placed in a juvenile detention facility where he was said to have contemplated suicide. soon afterwards he was readmitted to hospital and treated for ""major depression with psychotic episodes"". background information: article 6(5) of the international covenant on civil and political rights (iccpr), forbids the use of the death penalty against those who commit crimes when under 18 years of age. when the usa ratified the iccpr, it reserved the right to continue to sentence to death and execute juvenile offenders.  the un human rights committee, the body of experts set up to monitor compliance with the iccpr, has ruled that the us reservation to article 6(5) is incompatible with the object and purpose of the iccpr and should be withdrawn.  in 1998 the un special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions reiterated that the practice of sentencing to death and executing juvenile offenders violates international law. the federal government is responsible for ensuring that all us officials comply with their international obligations. there is a principle of international jurisprudence that the state is the subject of international law, regardless of whether its system is unitary, decentralized or federal, and is responsible for ensuring that all government authorities in the country abide by international law.  also under international law, states may not invoke domestic laws to avoid complying with their commitments under international treaties, expressly provided by the vienna convention on the law of treaties.  the latter also binds countries not to do anything which would defeat the object and purpose of a treaty which they sign, pending a decision on whether to ratify. the usa have signed the convention on the rights of the child, which forbids the use of the death penalty against those under 18 at the time of crime, but have not ratified it. this urgent action appeal originated from amnesty internationals research headquarters at the international secretariat in london, united kingdom. amnesty international is an independent worldwide movement working for the international protection of human rights. it seeks the release of men and women detained anywhere because of their beliefs, color, sex, ethnic origin, language or religious creed, provided they have not used nor advocated violence. these are termed prisoners of conscience. it works for fair and prompt trials for all political prisoners and works on behalf of such people detained without charge or trial. it opposes the death penalty, extra-judicial executions (political killings), disappearances and torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment of all prisoners without reservation. amnesty international opposes the death penalty in all cases as a violation of the right to life and the right not to be subjected to cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment, as proclaimed in the universal declaration of human rights in 1948. fifty years later, over 100 countries are abolitionist in law or practice. in contrast, some 480 inmates have been executed in the usa since executions resumed in 1977, over 350 of whom have been executed since 1990. the most recent was that of sammy roberts in south carolina on 25 september 1998. the usa has executed eight juvenile offenders since 1990, including two in 1998. only five other countries are known to have executed juvenile offenders in the same period, executing a total of nine such prisoners. virginia has not executed a juvenile offender since 1932. recommended action: please send telegrams/faxes/express/airmail letters: to the state governor: -
